The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription plan that you choose when you signed up for the service. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid subscription began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the netflix.com website and click on the "Account" page to see your next payment date. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of subscription or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Netflix subscription by visiting your account with the applicable third party.<br><br>3.2. <u class="doc-editor__marks__underline">Payment Methods.</u> To use the Netflix service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details. <br><br>3.3 <u class="doc-editor__marks__underline">Updating your Payment Methods.</u> You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s). <br><br>3.4. <u class="doc-editor__marks__underline">Cancellation.</u> You can cancel your Netflix membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Netflix service through the end of your billing period. To cancel, go to the "Account" page on our netflix.com website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. On the "Account" page you can see when your account will close. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Netflix membership, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Netflix service through that third party. <br><br>3.5. <u class="doc-editor__marks__underline">Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans.</u> We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time. We will notify you at least one month before any price changes or changes to your subscription plan will become effective. If you do not wish to accept the price change or change to your subscription plan, you can cancel your membership before the change takes effect. <br><br>3.6. <u class="doc-editor__marks__underline">No Refunds.</u> Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used subscription periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.

You and Netflix agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Netflix service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting any non-waivable statutory rights. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Netflix are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Netflix membership. <br><br>7.2. If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Netflix, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice"). The Notice to Netflix must be addressed to: General Counsel, Netflix, Inc., 121 Albright Way, Los Gatos, CA 95032 ("Notice Address"). If Netflix initiates arbitration, we will send a written Notice to you via the contact information that we have available for you. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Netflix, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Netflix and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Netflix may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. <br><br>7.3. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Netflix receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Netflix will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees. <br><br>7.4. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless Netflix and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your residence. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law. <br><br>7.5. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Netflix's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Netflix did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Netflix will pay you the amount of the award or US$5,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. <br><br>7.6. YOU AND NETFLIX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Netflix agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. <br></span></p><h2 id="602d0d0e-7dc1-4e56-a516-751ab621289f" class="export-block__parent " style="font-weight:600;font-size:inherit;padding:1.2rem 0px;margin-block-start:1.6rem;margin-block-end:0"></h2></li><li class="export-block__parent" style="font-size:initial"><p class="export-block__parent " style="font-size:initial"><span style="font-weight:bold" class="doc-editor__marks__bold"><span class="doc-editor__marks__fontFamily" style="font-size:initial;line-height:1.3">Miscellaneous</span></span><span class="doc-editor__marks__fontFamily" style="font-size:initial;line-height:1.3"><br></span><span class="doc-editor__marks__fontFamily" style="font-size:initial;line-height:1.3"><br></span><span class="doc-editor__marks__fontFamily" style="font-size:initial;line-height:1.3">8.1. </span><u class="doc-editor__marks__underline"><span class="doc-editor__marks__fontFamily" style="font-size:initial;line-height:1.3">Governing Law.</span></u><span class="doc-editor__marks__fontFamily" style="font-size:initial;line-height:1.3"> These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, U.S.A. without regard to conflict of laws provisions.
