# Privacy

At Airbnb, we want to build a world where anyone can belong anywhere – and the first step in that direction is creating a community that’s open, inclusive, and built on trust. A fundamental part of earning that trust means being clear about how we use your information and protect your human right to privacy. We know it can feel scary when companies use your information so we've put in place strong policies and practices that respect your privacy in both physical and digital spaces.

## Our privacy principles

Our commitment to privacy is represented in a set of principles that guide us in our decision making as we constantly strive to earn your trust.

### For your benefit

We use data to power your experiences and keep you safe. We don’t sell your personal data to anyone.

### Transparency

We are transparent about how we collect and use your personal data.

### Control

We put you in control of your personal data.

### Security

We protect the personal data you entrust to us through strong security measures.

For more detailed information on the data we collect, how we use it, and how to exercise your data subject rights, please review our [privacy policy](/terms/privacy_policy).
