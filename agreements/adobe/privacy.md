# Adobe Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 24, 2025

The Adobe Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Adobe’s Services and Software (as defined in our [General Terms of Use](/legal/terms.html)) and anywhere we display or reference this policy. If you are a resident of North America, your relationship is with Adobe Inc. (Adobe U.S.), which is the controller with regard to your personal information collected by Adobe, and the laws of California and the United States apply.

If you are a resident of Japan, your relationship is with Adobe KK, which is the controller with regard to your personal information collected by Adobe, and the laws of Japan apply.

If you reside outside of North America and outside of Japan, your relationship is with Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited (Adobe Ireland), which is the controller with regard to your personal information collected by Adobe, and the laws of Ireland apply.

If the content or information that you store in Adobe Services and Software contains personal information of other individuals, you must be legally permitted to disclose the personal information to Adobe.

## Summary of Key Points

At Adobe we take data privacy seriously. We believe in transparency so you can control your data and make informed choices about how it is used. We are here to support and protect your privacy decisions wherever you use our products and services. Adobe prioritizes your control over the data you store in the cloud in the following ways:

*   **This policy explains when we process personal information for our legitimate interests. You can ask us to stop processing this information.** [Learn more about your rights and how you can exercise them.](/privacy/policy.html#rights)

## What does this privacy policy cover?

This privacy policy describes how Adobe (also referred to as "we," "us" or "our") will make use of your information in the context of:

*   Adobe websites and web-based services (together referred to as "websites");
*   Services that display or include a reference to this policy;
*   Adobe’s marketing, sales, and advertising practices;
*   The privacy practices of previously acquired companies, unless otherwise noted here.

This privacy policy applies when (i) Adobe provides products and services directly to an individual (such as when you buy on Adobe.com or units via resellers) or (ii) Adobe collects usage information from employee users of Adobe enterprise customers (unless otherwise directed by an enterprise customer). In (i) and (ii), we are considered the “data controller” because we determine what personal data will be collected and how it will be handled, as detailed and allowed per this policy.

In contrast, Adobe is considered the “data processor” and not the data controller when enterprise customers such as businesses or educational institutions, use Adobe products and services (e.g., Adobe Experience Cloud) to support their own provision of products and services to individuals since Adobe acts at the direction of these enterprise customers regarding any collection or processing of data on their behalf. This privacy policy does not apply to the data Adobe enterprise customers may collect from individuals or their uses of that data. For questions about any specific organization’s data practices in these scenarios, please contact the organization directly. You can also find more privacy information about Adobe Experience Cloud [here](/privacy/experience-cloud.html).

**In some cases, different or additional privacy and data protection policies and notices apply.**

Some of our products and services have different or extra privacy details to consider. For example, when we acquire a company, their privacy policy and notices apply until such time as Adobe’s privacy practices are implemented. Also, certain products and locations have additional privacy policies and notices that may apply. You can find these, along with other relevant policies, on our [Additional Privacy Policies page](/privacy/policies.html) within the Adobe Privacy Center.

Please also see the [Adobe Terms of Use](/legal/terms.html) and any additional Terms of Use or Consumer [Product License Agreements](/legal/licenses-terms.html) that may apply to the Services and Software you are using.

In such cases, Adobe is acting only on your instructions in order to facilitate the Service requested by you, and you will be responsible for the information shared. In these instances, we will inform you through in-app notifications or other in-time communications. If you submit any information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with your use of Adobe apps or websites, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this policy.

**How we process your content to deliver features requested by you**

Adobe offers certain features that let you edit and organize your photographs, videos, and other types of content using characteristics like face and voice (e.g., you can group similar faces, places, and image characteristics within your collection), and such characteristics may be considered biometric identifiers or biometric information under certain US laws or other applicable privacy laws. When you choose to use these features, Adobe is acting only on your instructions in order to facilitate the service requested by you. These features are off by default and, should you choose to enable them, you can always disable these features. Where we process biometric identifiers or biometric information to deliver a feature requested by you, we delete this information once you turn off the feature, unless otherwise specified in the Software or Services.

**Visiting our Physical Offices**

When you visit an Adobe office, we will collect Identifiers and Contact information such as your name, company name, and email address; and Audio, electronic, visual, or similar information including facial images and voice information such as from CCTV video or voice recordings and photos.

## Does Adobe disclose my personal information to others?

**Disclosing to other Data Controllers**

We will disclose your personal information within the Adobe family of companies for the purposes identified above (see a list of [Adobe entities](/about-adobe/contact/offices.html) and our [acquired companies](/privacy/policies.html)).

We will also disclose your personal information with other third-party data controllers with your consent (where necessary) or to provide any product or service you have requested (e.g., third-party integrations). The types of third parties your information may be disclosed to include: our resellers and other sales and advertising partners, retailers, advertisers, ad agencies, advertising networks and platforms, information service providers, fraud monitoring and prevention providers, and publishers. In some cases, in order to show you more relevant ads, we disclose with social media platforms and other advertising partners, information about actions you take on our websites and apps, such as which pages you visit and which ads you saw. These parties may be joint controllers for this processing. More information is available [here](/privacy/marketing.html#online-advertising).

Third-party data controllers may also use Adobe products and services to collect and process your personal information. If you are using an email address that is associated with a business domain (e.g., yourname@businessname.com) to access Adobe's Services and Software, or if you were invited to use the Services and Software by a business, we may provide your personal information to that business.

**Disclosing for Fraud Prevention, Safety and Security Purposes**

We will disclose personal information to companies that help us run our business to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, deception, illegal activity, misuse of Adobe Services and Software, and security or technical issues.

Additionally, we will disclose personal information to companies, organizations, government authorities, or individuals outside of Adobe if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to detect, prevent, or protect against such fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal activity, misuse of our Services and Software, or security or technical issues, or where it is reasonably necessary to protect from harm the rights, property or safety of Adobe and our employees, our users, children, or the public as required or permitted by law.

**Disclosing to Data Processors**

We will also disclose your personal information to companies that help us run our business by processing personal information on behalf of Adobe for the purposes identified above. Such companies (including those that may record or store communications) include providers of customer support services, chatbots, session replay partners who provide services which recreate a web or app session showing meaningful insight into a visitor’s experience, providers of analytics technologies that record and analyze your interaction with our websites to help us improve your experience, providers of artificial intelligence technologies that record and analyze your content or communications, payment processing services, fraud monitoring and prevention, detecting and preventing deceptive or illegal activity or misuse of our Services and Software, email, social media, and other marketing platforms and service providers, and hosting services. We require these companies to protect your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Other Information Disclosure**

Adobe may also disclose your personal information:

*   When you agree to the disclosure;

*   If we merge with or are acquired by another company, sell an Adobe website, app, or business unit, or if all or a substantial portion of our assets are acquired by another company, your information will likely be disclosed to the prospective purchaser, our advisers and any prospective purchaser's advisers and will be one of the assets that is transferred to the new owner.

info-share

## Is my personal information displayed anywhere on Adobe’s websites or applications?

There are several places within Adobe’s Services and Software that allow you to post comments, upload pictures, participate in message boards or chats, engage with blogs, share technical information, or submit other content for others to see. Sometimes you can limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other users of the service. Such information can appear in search engine results or through other publicly available platforms and can be “crawled” or searched by third parties. For example, when users post content on message boards, online chats, blogs, and Community Forums, the information posted by the user will become public. Some online content may remain accessible publicly even after Adobe fulfils a request to delete the poster’s personal information.

Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you wouldn’t want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within an app or website that allows you to control who sees what you post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and app, your email address or name and/or profile photo may be included and displayed with your message. You can find more information about managing your public profile [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/edit-adobe-account-personal-profile.html). To remove content you have shared on our Services and Software, please use the same feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please [contact us](/go/privacyinquiry).

## Does Adobe transfer my personal information across national borders?

The main locations where we process your personal information are the US and India, but we also transfer personal information to all other countries in which Adobe or its affiliates, providers, and partners operate. We carry out these transfers in compliance with applicable laws – for example, by putting data transfer agreements in place to help protect your personal information.

Adobe complies with the EU-U.S., UK Extension to the EU-U.S., and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. To learn more, see our [Cross Border Data Transfers page](/uk/privacy/eudatatransfers.html), or visit the [U.S. Department of Commerce’s Data Privacy Framework website](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000TNo9AAG&status=Active).

As set out above Adobe uses a limited number of third-party service providers to assist us in providing our services to our users and business customers. These third parties may access, process, or store personal data in the course of providing their services. Adobe maintains contracts with these third parties restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal data in compliance with our Data Privacy Framework obligations, including the onward transfer provisions, and Adobe remains liable if they fail to meet those obligations and Adobe is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage).

The information above applies to Adobe users who are consumers. More information is available for our business customers that want to learn more about [Cross-border data transfers](/privacy/eudatatransfers.html).

## What rights do I have regarding my personal information and how can I exercise these rights?

When provided for by applicable law, you have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal information; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal information; and to obtain the personal information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this information to another controller. You may be entitled to additional rights based on applicable data privacy laws in your jurisdiction.

In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances (such as where we are using the information for direct marketing).

These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or which we need to defend claims against us. In addition, Adobe websites recognize the Global Privacy Control available in some web browsers. If your browser is configured to send this signal, Adobe will opt you out of Adobe’s use of advertising cookies on that browser. You can learn more about Adobe’s advertising practices and your privacy choices [here](/privacy/opt-out.html).

To exercise any of these rights (including deactivating your Adobe ID account), you can get in touch with us – or our data protection officer – using the details set out below. Additionally, many of our Services and Software allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the "[my account](https://account.adobe.com/)," "my profile," or a similar feature of the service you are using. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our Services and Software by logging in and using the deletion functions that are available.

If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to report them to your local privacy regulator or data protection authority and, where applicable, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with Adobe Ireland's lead supervisory authority (the Irish Data Protection Commission) or Adobe KK’s privacy regulator (the Personal Information Protection Commission).

When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain services or features, those services or features may not be available or fully functional. For example, to register with Adobe, to create an Adobe ID, and to use some Adobe Services and Software, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer an Adobe account to you, or provide you with the Services and Software requested. Other optional information, if not provided, may impact our ability to provide a personalized experience or tailored content or offerings.

## Withdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing

The Adobe family of companies (see list of [Adobe entities](/about-adobe/contact/offices.html) and our [acquired companies](/privacy/policy.html)) and companies we hire to help market our Services and Software on our behalf may use your information to provide you with information and offers related to Adobe.

Where we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your information for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time by:

*   Updating your preferences in your Adobe ID profile;
*   Updating your preferences in your specific website or app accounts;
*   Clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails;
*   Contacting us using the details provided at the end of this privacy policy.

## How long does Adobe retain my information?

When you register for an account and create an Adobe ID, we process and keep most personal information we process on your behalf for as long as you are an active user of our Services and Software. We delete certain personal information we collect about you when we no longer have a business reason to retain it. Additionally, there is some personal information we need to retain even after you close your account to comply with business and legal requirements, such as personal information related to our contract and business transactions with you, which we retain for ten years after your last interaction with us.

Where we process personal information for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the information until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a permanent record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your information so that we can respect your request in the future.

## Can children use Adobe websites and apps?

Certain products, including those listed below are available to children (individuals under the age of 13 or the equivalent age specified by law in your jurisdiction) but only under the direct supervision of an adult:

*   Adobe Express, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud apps are available to students, including children, for educational purposes under the supervision of school personnel. To provide these Student Services, Adobe collects student data on behalf of participating schools. For more information about how children’s data is handled in this context, see [Adobe’s COPPA Notice for Student Services](/cc-shared/assets/pdf/legal/documents/coppa-notice.pdf).
*   Project Aqua is an app designed for parents and guardians to use with children. For more information about how children’s data is handled in this app, see [Project Aqua Children’s Privacy Notice](/privacy/project-aqua-childrens-privacy-notice.html).

All other Adobe Services and Software are not intended for use by children and certain products specifically prohibit users who are under a certain age. If you do not meet applicable age requirements, please do not use those Services and Software. If you believe we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected personal information from a minor without appropriate permission or consent, please contact us using t[he privacy inquiry form](/go/privacyinquiry) (also found in the Contact section below) and we will take appropriate steps to respond to your request.

## Will this privacy policy change?

Occasionally, we may update this privacy policy (or other documents in the Adobe Privacy Center) to allow Adobe to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. If we do, we will change the "last updated" date at the top of this policy and the revised policy will be posted to this page so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it. We encourage you to periodically review the [Adobe Privacy Center](/privacy.html) and our [Adobe Privacy Policy Version History](/privacy/change-history.html) page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Under certain circumstances (for example with certain material changes or where it is required by applicable privacy laws) we will provide notice to you of these changes and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. Notice may be by email to you, by posting a notice of such changes on our Services and Software, or by other means consistent with applicable law.
