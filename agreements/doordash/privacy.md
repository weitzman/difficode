# **Introduction.**

At DoorDash, we connect people with the best of their neighborhoods by enabling businesses to meet consumers’ needs of ease and convenience, and, in turn, generate new ways for people to earn, work, and live.  

  

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how DoorDash, Inc. and its affiliates (“DoorDash”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collect, process, retain, and disclose your Personal Information when providing its services, including, but not limited to, its consumer platforms, websites, and mobile applications, any website, platform or application that contains or includes a link to this Policy, and channels of communication (collectively the “Services”). 

This Policy does not apply to Dashers or other contractors, or to the personnel of Merchants and Vendors, which are subject to separate privacy policies. 

# **What Personal Information does DoorDash collect or process?**

Personal Information is any information that DoorDash can reasonably use to identify you, whether that information identifies you on its own or when combined with other information. Anonymous information and information that has been de-identified such that it cannot identify you is not Personal Information.

We may process the following categories of Personal Information in connection with our Services:

*   **Contact Information,** including name, address (such as home address, work address, or other delivery address), email address(es), phone number(s), and other contact information provided to us.
*   **Account and Profile Information,** including username and credentials, privacy settings and notification preferences, pictures, and other information you add to your DoorDash profile, employer name if you are using our Services through our DoorDash for Business (formerly DoorDash for Work) product, any subscription information such as DashPass membership, and identifiers that we may link to an account and information received from third-party platforms or authentication services that are linked to our Services.
*   **Identification Documentation and Signature for Age-Restricted Products,** including driver’s license or other government issued identification documents, which we may process in limited circumstances such as an order for an age-restricted product (such as alcohol) or other products that require age and/or identity verification and for legal and regulatory compliance.
*   **Communications with DoorDash, Dashers and Merchants,** including the content of in-app messages with Dashers, communications with Merchants through or in-connection with our Services (including, without limitation, through our and third-party platforms), SMS/text messages, chats, phone calls, and emails with us related to our Services, customer support inquiries and outreach, the date and time of communications, method or channel used, call recordings (if applicable), the outcomes, actions, and/or resolutions from the communications, and other information. 
*   **Content you create or share,** including reviews about experiences on our platform, such as ratings of a Dasher who delivers an order or about Merchants you order from, or photos you upload.
*   **Payment Information,** including credit card or debit card information and information about the payment methods and services (such as PayPal or Venmo) used to make purchases on or through our Services. Payment information is primarily stored and processed by our third-party service providers, including our payment processors; however, we may store and process limited payment-related information such as the last four digits of a payment card, name of the financial institution, and payment service.
*   **Activity and Transactions on or with our Services, i**ncluding information about the items and products ordered, order history, items placed in the cart, special instructions included in an order (e.g., dietary preferences, delivery preferences), transaction amounts, promotional codes and discounts used and received, the Merchants ordered from, gift cards ordered, the features and functionality used or interacted with, searches and actions on our Services (including through using session replay technology), loyalty account information for Merchants, responses to our surveys or other market research activities, participation in sweepstakes, promotions, or contests, photos and/or videos that you may send or provide to us related to your activity and transactions on or with our Services, and use of DashPass, gifts, our referral program or other special programs (including information about those you have sent or received gifts to or from or referred).
*   **Geolocation Information,** if you have consented by enabling location access, we may receive and store your precise location information, including when our apps are running in the foreground (our app is open and on screen) or background (our app is open, not on screen) of your device. You may use our Services without enabling the collection of precise location information from your device; however, this may impact your experience including the accuracy of deliveries and/or the availability of certain content, features and functionality (e.g., you may have to manually enter your delivery address). If you have not allowed us to receive your precise location, we can only determine your approximate location. To opt-out of location sharing after turning it on, follow the steps below:

a. Open the DoorDash consumer mobile app.

b. Tap the account icon at the top right of the screen.

c. Under “Account Settings”, click “Privacy”.

d. Under “Location Access”, click the arrow “>” next to the current choice.

e. You will be taken to the app settings screen for DoorDash. Here, click the “Location” button.

f. Select the option to allow location access as desired. You will also have the choice to turn off precise location sharing.

*   **Device Information,** including information about the computers, phones, and other devices you use to interact with DoorDash or our Services, internet-protocol address, device-based identifiers, operating system and version, preferred language, hardware model identifiers, browser information including type and settings, and other device information.
*   **Information from Co-Branded or Third Party Offers**, we may collect information that you use to register for, and your activity with, third parties, in connection with co-branded or third party offers from us and our partners, such as when you enroll for co-branded credit card opportunities with our credit card partners.

  

Some of the information identified above that you choose to provide us (specifically, government issued identification and your signature, which we receive when we verify age and identity and the authenticity of a submitted government issued ID for certain orders (such as alcohol orders) to prevent fraud and demonstrate legal and regulatory compliance and precise location information, which we receive to facilitate deliveries and certain content, features and functionality within our Services), may be considered sensitive Personal Information under the laws of some jurisdictions. You can turn off DoorDash’s ability to collect and use precise location at any time in your app settings. We do not use any sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than as reasonably expected by an average consumer to provide our Services, for legal, security and safety purposes, and without the purpose of inferring characteristics about an individual. Where legally required, DoorDash will collect and process sensitive Personal Information only with consent. For more information on our processing of government issued IDs and data to verify age and identity and the authenticity of a submitted government issued ID, please see the FAQs available at [How is my age verified for alcohol orders?](https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/How-is-my-age-verified-for-alcohol-orders?language=en_US) 

  

When we process de-identified information, we maintain and use the information in de-identified form, and do not attempt to re-identify the information, except as permitted by applicable law.
