At Etsy, we care deeply about privacy. We strive to be transparent about what information we collect, and how we use, share and retain it.

This Privacy Policy explains our privacy practices for Etsy.com (which we’ll refer to as the "**Site**"), Etsy’s mobile applications, including the Etsy App and the Etsy Seller App (together, the "**Apps**"), [Etsy Payments](https://www.etsy.com/legal/etsy-payments/), [Pattern by Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/pattern/), Etsy’s public [Application Programming Interface](https://www.etsy.com/legal/api/) (the “**API**”), and other services provided by the Etsy companies (the "**Services**") set out at Section 11 (which we’ll refer to as "**Etsy**," or as "**we**," "*us*," and "**our**"). We’ll use the term “**Services**” to refer collectively to the Site, the Apps, Etsy Payments, Pattern by Etsy, and the API.

This policy applies to our registered buyers (“**Buyers**”) and sellers (“**Sellers**”) (together, our “**Members**”), those who purchase items on Etsy without an account (“**Guests**”) and anyone else who visits our Sites or uses our Services (together with our Members and Guests, “**you**” and “**your**”). This Privacy Policy, as well as our [Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/cookies) and [Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures](https://www.etsy.com/legal/cookies-disclosures) apply to all of your interactions with our Sites and our Services, including our [Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/cookies) and [Cookies & Similar Technologies Disclosures](https://www.etsy.com/legal/cookies-disclosures). If you are not a registered Member or a Guest, please see our Non-Member Privacy Policy for further information about how we may collect and use your information, available [here](https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/non-member-privacy-policy/1146287590828).

This policy does not apply to the practices of Etsy Sellers. It also does not apply to any third parties that you may choose to share information with when you use the Services. Please note that the collection and use of your information by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. You should understand the privacy and security practices of any third party before you share information with them.

It is important for you to understand how we use your information. You should read this policy in full, but some key points to help you navigate the policy are:

*   Etsy’s mission is to Keep Commerce Human. We are the marketplace for unique items from real people. We stay true to this by connecting buyers with items made, designed, handpicked, or sourced by creative sellers around the world.
*   By accepting our [Terms of Use](https://www.etsy.com/legal/terms-of-use) and this Privacy Policy, or by using any of our Services, you confirm that you have read and understand, and in countries outside the United Kingdom (“UK”) or European Economic Area (“EEA”) agree to this policy.
*   We collect and use your information to provide and improve our Services, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and to comply with our legal obligations. To learn more about the information we collect and how we use it, see [Section 1](#collect) and [Section 2](#use) below.
*   We share your information with other Etsy group companies, trusted partners and service providers to provide our Services, for security purposes, to understand how you use and interact with our Services and to meet our legal obligations. To learn more, see [Section 3](#share).
*   You have certain rights over our use of your data, including the right to object to certain types of processing that we carry out. For more information, see [Section 7](#rights).
*   Depending on your location, different Etsy entities may provide different parts of the Services to you. For more information on your relevant service provider(s) and data controller(s), along with details of how to contact them, see [Section 12](#contact).
*   If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to exercise your rights, see [Section 12](#contact) for further information about how to contact us. You can learn more about Etsy’s policies by visiting our [House Rules](https://www.etsy.com/legal?ref=breadcrumb) and [Help Center](https://help.etsy.com/hc/?segment=shopping).

## 2\. How We Use Your Information and Our Legal Basis

When you access or use the Services or interact with our Sites and/or Apps, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your information for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“**UK**”) (together referred to as the “**European Region**”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed below.

## 3\. How We Share Your Information

We share your data with third parties where necessary to provide the Services, comply with our legal obligations, or for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including:

**Publicly Displayed Information:** By using the Services, certain information about you will be publicly displayed on the Site and Apps, such as Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information (as defined in [Section 2](#use)). Buyers and Sellers can choose to make certain information and activities private through their account or Public Profile settings. We will also display other information connected with your use of the Services, including the date you joined, information relating to items you review (including the content of the reviews), photos or videos of items you purchased, your Favorites and Collections, followers, those you follow, comments you post in our community spaces, and information you decide to share via social networks. Your reviews of shops or items you’ve purchased may also be shared on other platforms and indexed by search engines, including Google.

For certain Sellers, some additional information may be publicly displayed. For example, your business name, shop location, or business registration number associated with your account (which you may modify and update in your account settings) may be publicly displayed.

**Etsy Group Companies:** We may share some of the information that we collect, such as Buyer Account Information, Seller Account Information, Seller Verification Information, Service Usage Information, Device and Browser Information, and Cookie Information, with our corporate affiliates, which include Etsy, Inc., Etsy Ireland UC, Etsy Payments Ireland Limited, Etsy Gifting LLC, Etsy UK, Ltd., other Etsy entities, and Etsy-owned affiliates (including Depop Ltd. ), that help us conduct business around the world (together, the “**Etsy Group Companies**”). The information shared among the Etsy Group Companies may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and generally to operate our business, including for ID verification purposes, transaction monitoring, fraud prevention, payment processing, marketing, the issuing of, and use of, gift cards as a payment method, legal and regulatory compliance, customer support, business development, user account administration, and IT, technical, and engineering support.

**Sellers:** We may share aggregated information about your use of the Services to Sellers, for example, if you are a frequent purchaser or a new Buyer, so they can provide you with better service and so we can improve our Site and Apps. To improve the shopping experience, we may collect and display certain Seller information, including when and how they interact and use the Services, in order to, for example, display when Sellers were last active, or to show average Seller response times.

**Linked Third-Party Websites or Services:** Some Members may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook or Google. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, the providers of those services or products may receive information about you that Etsy, you, or others share with them.

You can choose to link your payment processing or bank account to facilitate paying for purchases (or to receive payment and disbursements, in the case of Sellers in select markets) through a third-party service available through the Site or Etsy App. When you register with these third-party partners, we will tell you what information is collected and what information the third party will share with Etsy.

Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services in addition to our own terms and privacy policy.

**Business Partners:** Etsy works closely with a number of business partners, such as our delivery and payment partners, that assist us with providing the Services in accordance with our [Terms of Use](https://www.etsy.com/legal/terms-of-use). When one of these companies assists us in facilitating your transaction, we or they may need to share information related to the transaction in order to complete your order, monitor activity on the Sites and Apps, such as transaction activity, or to resolve post purchase support or transaction related issues, such as refunds or disputes.

Etsy also partners with other businesses to make Sellers’ products available off Etsy. Etsy and our partners will tell you how we and they collect, use, and share your information.

Etsy also offers services or products from affiliated businesses, such as services that assist our Sellers with accounting or other small business management services. These affiliated businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or offer promotions (including email promotions). In each case, these partners will process your information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your information to them.

**Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities, Regulators, and other Entities:** We share your information described in Section 2 with our advisors, consultants, regulators and tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, civil litigants, industry partners (for example, trade groups), and other entities as reasonably necessary to:

*   comply with applicable law or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, legal process, or government requests;
*   detect, investigate, prevent, or address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Etsy’s [Terms of Use](https://www.etsy.com/legal/terms-of-use), and other illegal activity or security and technical issues; and/or
*   protect the rights, property and safety of our Members, Etsy and the Etsy Group Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.

**Advertising and Marketing Services:** Etsy works with third-party advertising and marketing partners for interest-based advertising purposes as described [here](https://www.etsy.com/legal/cookies/#marketing-services).

**Business Reorganization:** In some cases, Etsy may choose to reorganize its business. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy’s assets), Member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a notice on the Site and the Apps.

**Community Services:** We engage third parties to assist in providing Community Services, which includes the Etsy Forums and Teams, and need to share certain information about you for these purposes. This may include, for example, Buyer Public Profile Information and Seller Public Profile Information, the date that you registered on Etsy, as well as your language and regional settings on the Site. For more information, see our [Community Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/community/).

**Service Providers:** Etsy also engages third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, analytics services, and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and advertise the Services. These third parties have limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for other purposes. In addition, Etsy also engages third-party service providers who facilitate the sharing of data between similar companies (e.g., retail companies) for purposes such as fraud prevention and security.

The types of third-party service providers that we work with include:

![](https://i.etsystatic.com/inv/834d32/7132569156/inv_fullxfull.7132569156_i1eap1q8.jpg?version=0)

## 4\. How We Transfer Your Information

Etsy operates a global e-commerce platform. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Etsy will use your information in the United States, Ireland, and any other country where the Etsy Group Companies operate. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. To the extent that Etsy is deemed to transfer information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:

**Adequacy Decisions** Where available, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognizing that certain countries offer a level of protection of data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. A list of adequacy decisions is available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) via the European Commission website.

**Standard Contractual Clauses** Otherwise, we also rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the international and onward transfer of your data outside of the EEA to third countries, including, for example, to the United States and India. This includes transfers from Etsy Ireland UC to Etsy, Inc. and other Etsy Group Companies in addition to our service providers. You can request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses by emailing dpo@etsy.com.

**Necessary for the Performance of the Contract Between Etsy and Its Users** You can choose whether or not to use the Etsy Services. As we operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us (including our [Terms of Use](https://www.etsy.com/legal/terms)), we transfer your information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your information outside of your home country, including the UK or EEA.

## 5\. How We Protect Your Information

The security of your information is important to us. We protect your information through technical and administrative measures designed to mitigate the risk of unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, or use of your data. To protect your account, we encourage you to choose your password carefully and enable two factor authentication (2FA) for signing in. You can learn more about enhancing your account security in your account settings.

We use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise and Mastercard’s Ekata (Mastercard’s identity verification product) in connection with our Services to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. reCAPTCHA Enterprise collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sends it to Google for purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving reCAPTCHA Enterprise and for general security purposes. Your use of reCAPTCHA Enterprise is subject to Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US) and [Terms of Use](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US). Mastercard’s use of your information to provide us fraud prevention solutions is subject to the [Ekata Privacy Policy](https://ekata.com/privacy-policy/).

## 6\. How Long We Store Your Information

Etsy will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, internal policies, or under applicable law. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis and depending on the retention laws applicable. The following factors typically affect the retention period.

**Necessity to provide our Services** We keep your information as long as necessary to provide the Services to you. This includes things like maintaining and improving the performance of our Sites and Apps, keeping our Services secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.

**Consent-based processing of data** If we process your data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary to process it according to your consent or until you withdraw your consent.

**Statutory, contractual, or other similar obligations** Etsy will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws, Know Your Customer (“KYC”), and similar obligations. Here's what we consider when deciding how long to keep your information:

## 7\. Your Rights and Choices

Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), provide users with rights and choices related to their information. Consistent with those laws, Etsy gives you the choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how we contact you. In addition, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to your information, such as the following:

*   **Right to Access:** You can access certain information associated with your account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a copy of your information in an easily accessible format, as well as an explanation of how that information is used. See this[Help Center article](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035753053-How-Do-I-Download-My-Etsy-Data-) for more information.
*   **Right to Portability:** You have the right to receive certain of your information which you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller.
*   **Right to Correction:** You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate information about you. You can correct and change certain information through your account settings.
*   **Right to Restrict Processing:** In certain cases, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your information.
*   **Right to Deletion:** In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion of your information, except information we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, rights, and integrity of Etsy. Please note that closing your account may not free up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a new account. See this [Help Center article](https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021647754-Can-I-Permanently-Delete-My-Etsy-Account-) for more information.
*   **Right to Object:** If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will stop processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons.

You have the right to request additional safeguards in these circumstances, such as the right to obtain a human review of the decision.

Turning off personalized advertising allows you to exercise your right to opt out.
