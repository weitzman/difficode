## **Welcome!**

Last updated: January 16, 2025

### **1\. Introduction and Scope**

These Consumer Terms of Service ("*Terms of Service*" or "*Terms*") are a legal agreement between us ( "us", "our", "we", or "Stripe") and you, the individual who uses one or more of the products and services we offer for your personal use under these Terms (referred to as "you" or "your"), which are Link, Financial Connections, and Identity (each, a "Consumer Service"). The following Terms are a legally binding agreement between you and us, and it describes the terms and conditions applicable to your use of our Consumer Services. By using our Consumer Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms, and any new features or tools that are added will also be subject to these Terms. The Stripe entity with which you are entering into these Terms depends on your location and can be found [here](https://link.com/terms/contracting-entity).

These general Terms apply to all of our Consumer Services that reference these Terms. Businesses that are using our products and services for business purposes ("Business Users") are subject to the [Stripe Services Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa).

### **2\. Additional Terms That Apply to You**

The following additional policies and terms also apply when you access or use the Consumer Services, all of which are incorporated by reference into these Terms:

*   [Arbitration Agreement](https://link.com/terms/arbitration). IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU AGREE TO OUR ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND STRIPE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH ARBITRATION, PROHIBITS YOU FROM MAINTAINING OR PARTICIPATING IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO A  JURY TRIAL, AND LIMITS THE TIME IN WHICH A CLAIM MAY BE BROUGHT.
*   Link E-Sign Disclosure. You agree to the [Link E-Sign Disclosure.](https://link.com/terms/e-sign-disclosure) It provides that we will communicate with you electronically. Your electronic agreement has the same effect as if you sign in ink, and you agree to receive notices through our Consumer Services.
*   Privacy Policy. You acknowledge the [Privacy Policy.](https://link.com/privacy) Stripe and the Business User are independent controllers of personal data collected in conjunction with the Consumer Services and will independently and separately determine the purposes and means of its processing of personal data.  We may transfer your personal data to countries other than your own country, including the United States. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully to understand how your information is collected, used, and shared in connection with these Consumer Services.  Learn more by reviewing [Link's Privacy Center](https://link.com/privacy-center).
*   Product-Specific Terms. A Consumer Service may have specific terms that apply when you use that particular Consumer Service. These product-specific Terms are listed in the left-hand menu.
*   [Acceptable Use Policy](https://link.com/terms/acceptable-use). Your use of a Consumer Service is subject to Stripe's Acceptable Use Policy.

We may revise these Terms from time to time. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes to these Terms in advance of their effectiveness, including by posting notice on the applicable Consumer Services or providing notice via an email address associated with you. The revised Terms will be effective on the date stated in the revised Terms. By using a Consumer Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to those changes. If you do not agree with any changes to these Terms, you must stop using the Consumer Services.

### **3\. Eligibility**

You may only enter into these Terms if you are over the age of majority and able to enter into a legally binding contract in the country in which you reside.

You must not use the Consumer Services if you have previously been terminated or suspended from using any of our services, including any Consumer Service. You may not enter into the Terms or use any Consumer Service if you are the target of government sanctions, such as those applied by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other national government.

You must be eligible for the particular Consumer Services to the extent they are available in your country. If we present an incorrect country for you or you move countries, then you must correct the country in your account or [contact support](https://support.link.com/contact) before using the Consumer Services again.

### **4\. Stripe’s Role**

Any contract of sale made using the Consumer Services is directly between you and the Business User. You, and not Stripe, are responsible for the purchases you make using the Consumer Services. The Business User, and not Stripe, is responsible for the goods or services that you may purchase from them using the Consumer Services, including but not limited to delivery, quality of goods, returns, accuracy, refunds, fraud, advertising, customer support, protection of intellectual property rights, liability relating to the Business User's products or services, or non-compliance with applicable law.

Your access to and use of the Consumer Services does not change your relationship with the Business User, third party services or platforms or with your bank or credit or debit card company.

Except as provided otherwise in these Terms, Stripe will not intervene in any dispute between you and a Business User for any transactions using the Consumer Services. If you find yourself in a dispute with a Business User or a third party, we encourage you to contact the other party and try to resolve the dispute. If you choose to [contact Stripe's support](https://support.link.com) team regarding a Business User, you acknowledge that we may, but are not required to, forward information about your issue, such as your email address and a summary of your issue to the Business User with a request that they contact you directly to resolve your concern. Except as provided otherwise in these Terms, Stripe will not make judgments regarding factual disputes or legal issues or claims between you and the Business User, and Stripe has no obligation to resolve any disputes. You release Stripe from any claims, demands, and damages arising out of disputes relating to your use of the Consumer Services, including those with other Business Users or parties.

We make no warranties with respect to the products, services or information provided by Business Users, and we are not responsible or liable for claims, including but not limited to: (a) product liability claims in respect of Business User products; (b) claims that the offer or sale of Business User products or services fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (c) claims respecting Business Users' products, services, or practices arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; (d) any inaccurate, incomplete or out of date information offered by a Business User; (e) infringement of intellectual property rights by the Business User; or (f) the acts or omissions of any third party platform where you may interact with or purchase from.

### **5\. Identification and Prevention of Fraud**

You agree that:

*   Information you provide about yourself and your use of the Consumer Services must be complete and accurate as of the time provided, and you must keep this information up-to-date;
*   To the extent law allows, we and our service providers may verify your identity, except as otherwise provided in product-specific terms. 
*   You must notify us immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use or access to your account. You are responsible for any actions taken through the use of your credentials, except for actions taken after you have told us that your account or credentials have been compromised.

### **6\. Communications via Text, Push Notification, Email, and Phone**

To the extent allowable under law, by providing us with a phone number, you consent to receiving text (SMS) messages, push notifications, and phone calls from us. Such communications may include, but are not limited to, requests for authentication, receipts, reminders, notifications regarding updates to your account or account support, requests for product feedback, and marketing or promotional communications. You acknowledge that you are not required to consent to receive promotional texts or calls as a condition of using any Consumer Service. Call and text message communications may be generated by automatic telephone dialing systems. Standard message and data rates your cell phone carrier applies may apply to the text messages we send you.

You may opt-out of receiving promotional email communications we send to you by following the unsubscribe options on such emails or by managing your communications preferences in the app. You may opt-out of text messages from Stripe by replying STOP or by following instructions that you receive in the text message. You may opt-out of phone calls by notifying the caller or by [contacting support](https://support.link.com/contact). You acknowledge that opting out of receiving communications may impact your use of Consumer Services.

### **7\. Our Intellectual Property Rights**

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms. The Consumer Services are protected by trademark, copyright, patent and other laws of the United States and other countries. We own all rights, title, interest in and to the Consumer Services and all copies of the Consumer Services, and all Intellectual Property Rights in them. Your use of the Consumer Services is subject to these Terms, and these Terms do not grant you any rights to our Intellectual Property Rights or the Intellectual Property Rights of our licensors, licensees, or partners.

For the purposes of these Terms, "Intellectual Property Rights" means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights, and other intellectual property rights that may exist now or come into existence in the future, and all of their applications, registrations, renewals and extensions, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.

### **8\. Feedback**

You may choose to submit feedback, ideas and suggestions about the Consumer Services, but it is never required. You may provide us with feedback on the Consumer Services by [contacting support](https://support.link.com/contact). You agree that we may use, integrate, and share all feedback, ideas, and suggestions you submit for any purpose and without compensation or obligation to you. You assign to us all rights, title and interest to any feedback, ideas and suggestions, including the right to use, modify and integrate them in any manner. 

### **9\. Termination**

**Termination by Us**: We may terminate these Terms (or any part), and we may limit, suspend, change, or remove your access to any or all Consumer Services, including any feature or aspect of the Consumer Services, at any time for any reason. If commercially reasonable, we will take reasonable steps to notify you before taking any action that restricts your access to the Consumer Services. If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms, we may terminate these Terms at any time without notice to you and accordingly we may terminate your access to the Consumer Services.

**Termination by You**: Subject to any product-specific Terms below, you may terminate any Consumer Service at any time and for any reason by terminating the Consumer Service or closing or [deleting your account](https://support.link.com/how-to-delete-your-saved-payment-information) as described below in the Link Account Terms. Termination will be effective on the date that your account is closed.

**Effect of Termination**. Upon termination, you will not have any further use of or access to the Consumer Services. Subject to applicable law, you will also not have any use of or access to any information you submitted through the Consumer Services, and all rights granted under these Terms will end. Termination does not relieve you of your obligations to pay amounts owed to Stripe, Business Users, or any other obligation contracted prior to termination. Termination does not revoke any third-party payment authorizations. The following provisions will survive even after these Terms terminate: Arbitration Agreement, Our Intellectual Property, Feedback, Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, Governing Law, Assignment and Third Party Beneficiaries, and Miscellaneous Terms.

### **10\. Disclaimer of Warranties**

Subject to statutory consumer guarantees, which will apply irrespective of this disclaimer, the Consumer Services are provided "as-is" and without any representation or warranty, whether express or implied. We, our affiliates, and our respective agents, contractors, and Business Users (together, the "Disclaiming Entities") make no representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever (other than those implied by statute) with respect to the Consumer Services or the content, materials, information and functions we make accessible, and specifically disclaim all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. We do not promise that the Consumer Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, free from cyber attacks, or secure.

The Disclaiming Entities do not control or make any warranties regarding the products or services others provide in connection with the Consumer Services. In other words, we do not have control over the businesses from which you're purchasing when using the Consumer Services, and we do not promise or imply that the products or services you buy using the Consumer Services will work as promised or be safe to use.

Some laws limit or prohibit disclaiming the warranties referred to in the previous paragraphs, or impose obligations on us that we can't eliminate with these Terms. In those cases, this section (Disclaimer of Warranties) does not restrict, exclude or modify any consumer rights under any applicable law.

### **11\. Limitation of Liability**

The Disclaiming Entities will not be liable to you for any failure to perform our obligation under these Terms due to a **Force Majeure Even**t. A "Force Majeure Event" is any event beyond the control of the Disclaiming Entities that significantly impacts Stripe’s ability to perform its obligations under these Terms, including a strike or other labor dispute; labor shortage, stoppage or slowdown; supply chain disruption; embargo or blockade; telecommunication breakdown; cyber blackout; power outage or shortage; inadequate transportation service; inability or delay in obtaining adequate supplies; weather; earthquake; fire; flood; act of God; riot; civil disorder; civil or government calamity; epidemic; pandemic; state or national health crisis; war; invasion; hostility (whether war is declared or not); terrorism threat or act; Law; or act of a Governmental Authority.

Subject to applicable consumer laws in your country, which will apply irrespective of this limitation of liability, the Disclaiming Entities will not be liable to you for any failure to perform our obligations under these Terms where performance of that obligation would have put us in violation of applicable law.

The Disclaiming Entities will not be liable to you in any circumstances for:

*   Loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, or loss of profit; or
*   Any loss that we could not have reasonably anticipated

Subject to the specific product Terms below and applicable consumer laws in your country, in no event will a Disclaiming Entity's liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms exceed $200 USD.

You and we agree that the other has relied on the disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability stated above in entering into these Terms, the limitation and disclaimer are essential to the agreement between you and us under these Terms, and they will apply to the fullest extent allowed by law.

Some laws restrict our ability to disclaim or limit our liability. In those cases, this section does not restrict, exclude or modify any consumer rights under any applicable law.

### **12\. Governing Law**

If you reside in the United States, California law will govern any claim or dispute between you and us that arises out of these Terms, regardless of conflict of law principles.

If you reside outside of the United States, your governing law is specified [here.](https://stripe.com/legal/consumer/governing-law/preview)

### **13\. Assignment and Third-Party Beneficiaries**

You must not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone without our prior written consent. We may delegate performing our obligations, and we may assign our rights and novate our obligations under these Terms to Stripe affiliates, at any time for any reason by providing notice to you. 

### **14\. Miscellaneous Terms**

These Terms, together with the Arbitration Agreement (if applicable), E-Sign Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, and the product-specific Terms below are the only agreement between you and us regarding the Consumer Services. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict or inconsistency between a provision in these Terms and any product-specific Terms below, the provision in the product-specific Terms will govern. These Terms do not create any partnership, joint venture, or other agency relationship between you and us. If we do not immediately exercise a right we have under these Terms, we do not waive that right. We retain our ability and right to enforce any part of these Terms at a later time. If any part of these Terms is found unenforceable, that part will be ignored, and all of the remaining terms will remain in effect.

## Link Account Terms

### **1\. Description of Link**

Link is a service that allows you to save and manage your information for an accelerated experience ("Link"). Link powers an accelerated checkout by storing your information upon your authorization and retrieving it for faster checkouts. When you make a purchase at a business that uses Stripe and offers Link as an accelerated checkout option (a "Link Merchant"), you will be asked if you would like to save your information or use your information saved to your Link account for future payments across Link Merchants when you are logged in with us on the same browser, app or device.

When you authorize us to save your information, you are signing up for Link and creating a Link account ("Link Account"), and we will collect and store certain personal data from you, such as:

1.  Your name, email address, and mobile phone number ("Account Information"); 
2.  Your credit card, debit card, bank account information, and billing address ("Payment Information"); 
3.  Your shipping address ("Shipping Information"); and 
4.  Information related to your purchase from a Link Merchant, such as the order date, amount, and product details (such as name, price, photos) ("Order Information"). 

Together, your Account Information, Payment Information, Shipping Information and Order Information are your "Saved Information." We will use all personal data we collect about you in accordance with the [Link Privacy Policy](https://link.com/privacy), including to develop and analyze our services and to share with our Link Merchants and our Business Users. The data we share with Link Merchants and Business Users may include: (i) the fact that you have a Link Account, (ii) the fact that you completed a purchase using Link, and (iii) the payment method type used for a purchase you made using Link. Business Users are businesses that are using our products and services for business purposes, subject to the [Stripe Services Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa). We may also share your Account Information with our financial partners in order to assist you in obtaining services from our financial partners. 

When you use Link on a Link Merchant's website, we or the Link Merchant will use cookies or similar technologies to associate your web browser, app, or device (or data regarding your web browser, app, or device) to your Link Account and to recognize you when you visit that Link Merchant or another Link Merchant on the same web browser, app, or device. You will be able to log in to your Link Account to access your Saved Information by inputting your email address and using a passkey or a verification code sent to you via SMS text message or by email. You can then make purchases using your Account Information, Payment Information, and Shipping Information across Link Merchants when you are logged in with us on the same browser, app or device. When you are logged into Link, we will provide the Link Merchant with your Account Information, Payment Information, and/or your Shipping Information to facilitate a faster checkout. If you are not logged in to Link, for example, because your session has expired, you've cleared your cookies, or you're using a device that is different from the one you used to last access Link, you may log in again via the same method outlined above.

### 2\. **Use of Link: Your Rights and Obligations**

*   You may only save Payment Information with us that you are authorized to use.
*   When you are logged into your [Link Account](https://app.link.com/login) and you input or use a new payment method (such as a different debit or credit card, or a different bank account), you authorize Stripe to save that new payment method information to your Link Account as part of your Payment Information. The last payment method you used to make a successful transaction may become your default payment method the next time you are completing a transaction on a Link Merchant's site. You may also change your default payment method by logging into your [Link Account](https://app.link.com/login) on app.link.com.
*   Message and data rates may apply for any SMS messages that we send to you, or you send to us. If you have any questions about your text plan or data plan, contact your wireless or mobile provider.
*   We reserve the right to modify or terminate Link or any of the features or tools provided therein for any reason (acting in our reasonable discretion), and at any time. We will try to notify you first unless it is unreasonable to do so.
*   We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### **3\. Updating or terminating your Link Account**

*   These Link Account Terms are effective unless and until they are terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Link Account Terms at any time by [deleting your Link Account](https://support.link.com/how-to-delete-your-saved-payment-information).
*   If you want to delete your Saved Information, your Link Account, or stop storing information using Link, please let us know by visiting [https://support.link.com/how-to-delete-your-saved-payment-information](https://support.link.com/how-to-delete-your-saved-payment-information) and submitting your email address.
*   You can manage your Saved Information on your [Link Account](https://app.link.com/login), the next time you checkout on a Link Merchant site, or by visiting [https://support.link.com](https://support.link.com/) for more instructions. Should you update your Payment Information, you authorize Stripe to validate and store your Payment Information, including your credit card, on file.
*   If your access to your Link Account is terminated by you or us, we will delete your Saved Information in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://link.com/privacy).

### **4\. Adding or Removing a Payment Method**

*   You can add or remove certain payment methods to your [Link Account](https://app.link.com/login) such as a credit card, debit card, a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) account, or a U.S. bank account. Before linking a payment method, you should review and understand the consumer protection rights and remedies available for different payment sources in your jurisdiction, such as under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) in the United States.
*   If you add a BNPL account to your Link Account, your BNPL account will remain logged-in via your Link Account. This means that you will not need to separately log in to your BNPL account to access it via Link. It also means that access to your Link account will also provide access to your BNPL account. 
*   Please keep your Payment Information current (e.g., credit card number and expiration date). If this information changes, you authorize us to, as permitted by and in accordance with the law, update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part. If you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your Payment Information from your [Link Account](https://app.link.com/login).
*   Removing a payment method from your [Link Account](https://app.link.com/login) does not cancel or change any amounts you still owe to a Link Merchant or to a BNPL provider. Specifically, if you remove a payment method from your Saved Information, this will not terminate or cancel any outstanding payment plans you may have entered into with a BNPL provider or any subscriptions you may have purchased with a Link Merchant using your Saved Information. You must cancel your subscriptions with the Link Merchant directly, and you must manage your BNPL payment plans with the BNPL provider directly.
*   Where applicable, we may ask you to connect your bank account to your Link Account to make it easier to pay with your bank account subsequently through your Link Account. Any bank account you choose to save to your Link Account is referred to as a "Saved Bank Account." Through your Link Account and under the Financial Connections Terms, you may also choose to provide your Saved Bank Account details directly to a Business User regardless of whether Stripe is involved in a subsequent transaction. We will collect data from your Saved Bank Account (and other accounts under the same account credentials) pursuant to the [Financial Connections Terms](https://link.com/terms#financial-connections-terms) and the [Link Privacy Policy](https://link.com/privacy). We may use your Saved Bank Account data to, among other things, verify that your Saved Bank Account is valid, check your balance to confirm there are sufficient funds for your purchase, streamline your requested payments and assess your eligibility for and offer you Consumer Services that we or our affiliate provides. You authorize us to credit amounts or otherwise send payments to the bank account you would like to save to your Link Account and your existing Saved Bank Account(s), including to determine whether your bank account is valid and active, as well as for promotions and refunds.
*   Each time you use your Link Account to pay a Link Merchant using your Saved Bank Account, you are authorizing the Link Merchant to debit your Saved Bank Account for up to the total amount you authorize the merchant to charge ("Total Authorized Amount") pursuant to the [Link Bank Payments Authorization](https://link.com/terms/ach-authorization). You authorize us to retry a debit on your Saved Bank Account if your bank rejects the original debit. If the Link Merchant chooses, they may debit your Saved Bank Account, pursuant to your [Link Bank Payments Authorization](https://link.com/terms/ach-authorization), for amounts less than the Total Authorized Amount, which in the aggregate will not exceed the Total Authorized Amount. Where your Saved Bank Account is a U.S. bank account, you agree that your grant of the authorization in this paragraph complies with the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA) operating rules and has the same legal effect as if you had signed a paper mandate containing the same terms.
*   If you do not see an option to pay using a bank account through your Link Account, it may be because the Link Merchant has not allowed those payments or the Link Merchant or bank is not eligible for bank payments via our Consumer Services. If your bank account transaction fails without an actual attempt to debit your Saved Bank Account, it may be because we determined the transaction is at high risk of being returned unsuccessfully (e.g. if your historical account balance is below the transaction amount). This can help prevent you from incurring insufficient funds fees from your bank. We recommend that you use a different bank account or payment method or reach out to us if you have questions. Your use of your bank account as a payment method is also subject to the terms, benefits, and protections associated with your personal bank account. If you use your bank account as a payment method and do not have sufficient funds to make a purchase, you could incur overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees or other fees with your bank.
*   If at any time you would like to revoke your [Link Bank Payments Authorization](https://link.com/terms/ach-authorization) or you no longer want your Saved Bank Account to be a payment method saved to your Link Account, you must delete your Saved Bank Account as a payment method from your [Link Account](https://app.link.com/). If a payment with your Saved Bank Account was not initiated from your Link Account but involved Link or Stripe connecting your financial account with that Business User, please see the Financial Connections Terms or [this page](https://support.stripe.com/user/how-do-i-disconnect-my-linked-financial-account) for information on how to disconnect your Saved Bank Account.

### 5\. **Backup payment method**

*   If your default or selected payment method is unavailable, or the transaction is unsuccessful using that payment method (for example, because your Saved Bank Account has insufficient funds), the Link Merchant may initiate a transaction on any other payment method saved to your Link Account (a "Backup Payment Method"). Generally, transactions on Backup Payment Methods will be attempted in the following order, if applicable: (1) Saved Bank Account, (2) debit card, and (3) credit card. In some cases, a Backup Payment Method of the same type will be used (for example, if your default payment method is a card, the Backup Payment Method may also be a card).
*   We will identify that a Backup Payment Method applies before you complete the purchase (e.g., whether during a one-time checkout or for any subscription payments, during the initial subscription purchase). 
*   If you do not wish to have a Backup Payment Method used, you may either (i) not consent to the use of the Backup Payment Method or (ii) manage your payment methods on your [Link Account](https://app.link.com/login).

### **6\. Beta Program**

If you would like access to Link’s newest products and services, you can opt in to participating in the Link beta program via the settings in your [Link Account](https://app.link.com). When you join the Link beta program, you are authorizing us to process your Saved Information to determine if you are eligible for our newest products and services. We may also send you communications to market the availability of a new product or service.

### **7\. Security**

*   We take the protection of your Saved Information seriously and have  implemented technical and organizational measures designed to safeguard it from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. These measures include industry-standard practices and technology to help maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your data. 
*   While we strive to provide robust security, no system is completely foolproof. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or misuse your Saved Information. We encourage you to remain vigilant and take responsibility for securing your personal data, knowing that you provide it at your own risk. 
*   Learn more about our security [here.](https://support.link.com/questions/how-does-link-protect-my-data) If you have reason to believe that the security of your Link Account has been compromised, please contact us immediately at [support.link.com/contact](https://support.link.com/contact).

### **8\. Dormant Accounts**

*   If your Link Account remains inactive for a continuous period of two years, we may consider the account dormant and may close your Link Account at our discretion (a "Dormant Account").
*   A Link Account is considered a Dormant Account if you have not done any of the following Link Account activities during a continuous two year period:
*   Making a payment or purchase using Link at a Link Merchant;
*   Adding, updating or removing any of your Saved Information;
*   Initiating account settings changes or updating security preferences;
*   Engaging with customer support related to your Link Account, including inquiries or disputes; or
*   Logging in to your Link Account and browsing or reviewing transaction history.
*   Prior to closing the Dormant Account, Stripe will notify you using the email address associated with your Link Account. Starting from the date of our notice to you, we will provide you with a period of 30 days to reactivate your Link Account by logging in and performing any Link Account activity listed above.
*   If Stripe does not receive a response or the account remains inactive after the 30-day notice period, your Link Account will be closed.

### **9\. Protection from Unauthorized Transactions (only for U.S. consumers)**

*   You may view your Link Account statement that shows your Link Account transactions and certain Order information by logging into your [Link Account](https://app.link.com/login) ("Link Transaction History").
*   To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your Link Account, you should regularly log into your Link Account and review your Link Transaction History. You should review transaction details to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.
*   Stripe will protect you from unauthorized transactions initiated with your Link Account. When this protection applies, Link will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.
*   *What is an Unauthorized Transaction?* An "Unauthorized Transaction" occurs when your Link Account is used to make a purchase with a debit card issued by a U.S.-based bank or a U.S. bank account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you. For example, if someone steals or fraudulently obtains access to your Link Account and makes a purchase using your Link Account with a saved U.S. debit card or a U.S. Saved Bank Account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.
*   *What is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction?* The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:
    *   If you grant authority to someone to use your Link Account (by giving them your login information) and they exceed the authority you gave them. You are responsible for transactions made in this situation unless you have previously notified Stripe that you no longer authorize transactions by that individual.
    *   Other unauthorized purchases using the Saved Bank Account, including via Stripe's payment processing services, but that are not initiated with your Link Account. For those types of unauthorized purchases, contact your financial institution to report the unauthorized activity.
*   Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction.
    *   If you believe your Link Account has been compromised, please contact Link consumer support immediately at [support.link.com/contact](https://support.link.com/contact) or call 1-888-820-7551.
    *   Tell us IMMEDIATELY if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using your login information or by other means. If you tell us within the 60 days after we provide you with your Link Transaction History showing transfers you did not make, you may be eligible for a refund of the full amount paid for Unauthorized Transactions.

### **10\. Error Resolution (only for U.S. consumers)**

*   *What is an Error?* An "Error" means the following:
    *   An "Unauthorized Transaction", as it is defined above.
    *   When a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your Link Account.
    *   You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your Link Account.
    *   An incorrect amount is credited to your Link Account.
    *   A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your Link Transaction History.
    *   We make a computational or mathematical error related to your Link Account.
    *   You request Link Transaction History that Stripe is required to provide to you.
    *   You request information concerning pre-authorized (recurring) transfers from your Link Account that Stripe is required to provide to you.
    *   You request additional information or clarification concerning a transfer from your Link Account, including a request you make to determine whether an error has occurred.
    *   You inquire about the status of a pending transfer from your Link Account.

## Financial Connections Terms

We provide a Consumer Service that allows you to connect your U.S. financial accounts to easily share your financial account data with Stripe and our affiliates (and to the extent identified, our Business User with which you are interacting), so that you can receive better product experiences. These Financial Connections Terms, along with the [Consumer Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/legal/consumer), apply when you use this Consumer Service.

When you interact with a Business User that has enabled this Consumer Service, we will ask you to connect one or more of your financial accounts. If you agree to connect your financial accounts with us, Stripe will collect data from those financial accounts (associated with the login information you provide) for account selection and as reasonably necessary to provide this Consumer Service. We will only provide the Business User with the data categories (and related insights) requested by the Business User for the specific accounts you choose to share with the Business User. 

Your financial account data is either provided directly by your financial institution, or collected by us or our third party partners by collecting, storing and using your login information (such as your username and password). We refer to these financial institutions and partners as “Data Sources.” Finicity Corporation is one of our Data Sources, and their terms are available [here](https://connect.finicity.com/assets/html/connect-eula.html) and incorporated into these Financial Connections Terms by this reference. Where our Data Sources enable us to control the specific accounts to which Stripe accesses data, Stripe will not collect data except from the specific accounts you select. 

When you agree to connect your financial account using this Consumer Service, you consent to the collection, use, and retention of your financial account data (including personal data) for that financial account. Once connected to your financial account(s), we and our Data Sources will regularly collect, use, and store the following types of data from your financial accounts:

*   Account owner information, including contact information (such as your name and address);
*   Account balances, including current and pending balances;
*   Account details, including your account type and bank, and account and routing numbers;
*   Account transactions, including balance, transaction date, payee, location, transaction, description, and amount.

Among other things, we may use your data to:

*   Verify your financial account;
*   Facilitate the processing of your requested payments;
*   Mitigate fraud, financial loss, or other harm to you, our Business Users, and us;
*   Assess your eligibility for and offer you our other products or services;
*   Analyze, develop, and update this Consumer Service and our other products and services;
*   Provide you customer support;
*   Comply with law, and enforce our terms; and
*   For other purposes consistent with your consent and applicable law.

For example, we may use your financial account data to decrease the likelihood that you are charged with insufficient funds fees or experience an ACH return and to assess your eligibility for and offer you Consumer Services that we or our affiliates provide. Please review the Financial Connections [FAQs](https://support.stripe.com/topics/linked-financial-accounts) to learn more. We will use your personal data in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy). 

We will only provide the Business User the categories of financial account data (including related insights) that the Business User requests and with your permission. Please remember, however, that our [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) covers our privacy practices, and not our Business Users’ privacy practices. Business Users may use your financial account data, for example, to verify that your account is valid and to check your account balance. 

In some cases, we and our Data Sources collect and store your financial institution login information, depending on the type of connection that we have with your financial institution. You authorize, and represent that you have the lawful right to authorize, us and our Data Sources to log into and access the data in your connected financial account(s) for the purposes described above. In order to provide you a better experience, you also authorize Stripe or our Data Sources to save, to remember, to trust or to take a similar action for account logins solely by Stripe or our Data Sources. We or our Data Sources may also be notified that account login is pending your action (such as your entry of a multifactor authentication code).  We may prompt you to complete that action directly in your financial institution’s application. This Consumer Service is not endorsed or sponsored by any financial institution whose account(s) are accessible through this Consumer Service, and we are not an agent of those financial institutions.

We will only provide the Business User with the data categories (and related insights) requested by the Business User for the specific accounts you select to share with the Business User. Otherwise, we disclose your financial account data and login information only to our trusted service providers and to the Data Sources only as necessary to provide this Consumer Service. We have implemented security controls that are designed to safeguard your data. To learn more, please visit [https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe.](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe) 

If you want to disconnect your financial account from access by the Business User, you may do so through our [disconnection form.](https://support.stripe.com/how-to-disconnect-a-linked-financial-account) Once your financial account has been disconnected, the Business User cannot access any subsequently refreshed financial account data from Stripe. Disconnecting your account or deleting your personal data from Stripe may not cancel or stop payments (including recurring payments) that you have already authorized. If you would like to request our Business User to cease debiting your account or to delete any copies of your data they obtained through this Consumer Service, please contact the Business User directly. 

Stripe typically does not collect additional information from your disconnected financial account. In some cases, however, our Data Sources (or your financial institution) do not enable us to cease collecting your financial account data until all accounts associated with the applicable login information have been disconnected. You can also use our [disconnection form](https://support.stripe.com/how-to-disconnect-a-linked-financial-account) to request that we disconnect all accounts and to delete the financial account data we obtained (and associated login information, if we have collected them). 

You may choose for us to save your financial account for future use across our eligible Business Users, including when you check out on their websites and applications.  When you authorize us to save your financial account to Link, you are signing up for Link and creating a Link Account, and we will collect and store certain personal data from you, such as your name, email address, and mobile phone number. Please see the [Link Account Terms](https://stripe.com/legal/consumer#link-account-terms) for more information about Link Accounts.

## Identity Terms

If you agree to save your identity information to your Link Account or verify your identity using your Link Account, you may choose to use your Link Account to share your identity verification data in the future with Stripe or other eligible businesses (i.e., our Business Users).  This identity verification data may include the personal data you provided (such as a photo of your driver's license or passport) and our verification results (including insights).

We generate verification results by comparing the information you provide with information about you that we collect from our Business Users, partners, identity verification service providers, and publicly available sources. If you agree for us to verify your identity using your identity document and your photo, your verification results are based on the biometric identifiers we generate and store from your images. [Learn More](https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity). Stripe will use this information as a [controller](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/obligations/controllerprocessor/what-data-controller-or-data-processor_en#:~:text=The%20data%20controller%20determines%20the,it%20is%20the%20data%20controller.) to verify your identity.

Stripe or Business Users may ask you to verify your identity for a number of reasons, including for compliance purposes, to confirm that you do not already have an account or that you are authorized to use a payment method. To the extent Stripe asks to verify your identity for its own purposes we may do so, including to comply with our own legal obligations, and for loss and fraud prevention and security purposes.

An advantage of saving your identity information to, or verifying your identity with, your Link Account is that you may not need to go through the trouble of re-submitting your identity information for other Business Users in the future.  Rather, you may be able to verify your identity more quickly and easily by providing consent to share the verification data you saved to your Link Account with specific Business Users. Before you agree to verify your identity with data saved to your Link Account, we will inform you whether your verification data will be used by Stripe or shared with that Business User. If you agree to share your verification data with a Business User, please note that Business User is an independent controller of your verification data, and the Business User's use of your data is subject to the Business User's privacy policy.

If you want to delete your identity information from your Link Account, there are instructions for how to do so [here](https://support.link.com/how-to-delete-your-saved-identity-document).  If you choose to delete your identity information from your Link Account, please note Stripe or the Business User may still have your verification data. If you would like to request the Business User to delete any copies of your personal data they obtained through this End User Service, please contact the Business User directly.

## Sold Through Link Terms

When you purchase digital goods or digital services from a Business User that is stated as “Sold through Link” (each purchase, an “**Order**”), then these Sold through Link Terms and the Purchase Terms below apply to you. When you use Link to manage and receive support for your Orders, then the Buyer Services Terms below apply to you. The Consumer Terms of Service are incorporated in these Sold through Link Terms by reference. Additional terms may apply to you based on your location as described in the Country or Region Specific Provisions. If you do not agree to these Sold through Link Terms or any of the additional terms incorporated by reference, please do not complete your Order.

**Relationship to Consumer Terms**

Stripe and its affiliates facilitating your ability to place an Order is a Consumer Service under the Consumer Terms of Service. The Buyer Services are Consumer Services under the Consumer Terms of Service. These Sold through Link Terms replace those sections of the Consumer Terms of Service identified in the list below. When you place an Order or use the Buyer Services (as described in the Buyer Services Terms below), these Sold through Link Terms control if there is a conflict with any Consumer Terms of Service or Link Account Terms.

**Sections of the Consumer Terms of Service replaced by these Sold through Link Terms**

You authorize us and our affiliates to share all Order-related information, including your contact information (e.g., name, email address, phone number, etc.), billing and shipping address, payment information, tax identification number, and order details (e.g., order date, price, etc.) (collectively, “**Order Data**”), with the Business User and the Business User will have access to your Order Data.

We do not promise that the Buyer Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, free from cyber attacks, or secure.

The Disclaiming Entities do not control or make any warranties regarding the products or services Business Users provide in connection with your Order or the Buyer Services. In other words, we do not promise or imply that the products or services you buy under an Order will work as promised or be safe to use.

Some laws limit or prohibit disclaiming the warranties referred to in the previous paragraphs, or impose obligations on us that we can't eliminate with these Terms. In those cases, this section (Disclaimer of Warranties) does not restrict, exclude or modify any consumer rights under any applicable law.

You and we agree that the other has relied on the disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability stated above in entering into these Sold through Link Terms, the limitation and disclaimer are essential to the agreement between you and us under these Sold through Link Terms, and they will apply to the fullest extent allowed by law.

Some laws restrict our ability to disclaim or limit our liability. In those cases, this section does not restrict, exclude or modify any consumer rights under any applicable law.

### Purchase Terms

Stripe’s affiliate, Lemon Squeezy LLC, (“**Link SMP**”) provides Stripe Managed Payments services to the Business User to facilitate your Order from the Business User. Stripe Managed Payments services are provided to the Business User and not to you. These Purchase Terms are part of the Sold Through Link Terms and apply when you place an Order. Link SMP is a third party beneficiary of the Sold Through Link Terms.

**Stripe’s Role.**

When placing an Order, Link SMP will charge or debit your selected payment method for the Order on behalf of the Business User, which will be reflected in your card, bank or payment method statement as a payment for your Order from “Link.com \* \[Business User name\]” or similar. Link SMP or its affiliates may request and collect any of the following information to calculate appropriate indirect taxes (sales taxes, VAT, GST, etc.) for Orders: your billing information, shipping information, and tax identification number. Link SMP or its affiliates may use Order Data for fraud, security and product improvement reasons. Payment for your Order will be processed by affiliates of Link SMP using the payment method you select at checkout. Your payment to Link SMP or its affiliates satisfies your payment obligations to the Business User for your Order.

The Business User has appointed Link SMP to facilitate the sale of its product on its behalf. The Business User, and not Stripe or Link SMP, is responsible for the products that you purchase from them through Link SMP, including delivery (unless fulfilled by Link SMP), quality of goods, returns, accuracy, fraud, advertising, protection of intellectual property rights, liability relating to the Business User's products or services, and compliance with applicable law. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with the terms and conditions between you and the Business User that apply to the products you purchase through an Order.

**Placing and Paying for Orders.**

When placing an Order, you may only pay with the payment methods accepted in the checkout by the Business User, which may vary based on your location. Certain Orders may require the preauthorization of your payment method with the actual charge following the preauthorization, for example, Orders for subscriptions with an initial free trial period or preorders. If your payment method does not support preauthorizations, then your payment method will be charged when the Order is placed. The payment method you use to purchase your Order will be used for ongoing subscription payments.

You, and not Link SMP or its affiliates, are responsible for any fees or surcharges applied by your bank or payment method used related to the transactions processed for Orders (such as foreign transaction fees or cross border fees). Buyer Services cannot assist you with disputes related to these fees or surcharges.

**Declined or Cancelled Orders.**

Link SMP and its affiliates may decline or cancel any Order if it or they reasonably believe there is suspected fraud, security risk or violation of Stripe terms or policies. Link SMP and its affiliates also reserve the right to decline or cancel abnormal Orders, Orders based on actual or suspected errors, or any Orders which Link SMP or its affiliates suspects are made in bad faith. For Orders cancelled on the basis of actual or suspected error, Link SMP will refund the amount you actually paid. If your Order exceeds a quantity limitation for the product being purchased, Link SMP and its affiliates may decline or cancel your Order.

**Subscription Migration**

Link SMP reserves the right to transfer or assign your subscriptions that you purchased through an Order to an affiliate, and such affiliate will assume the responsibilities and obligations of Link SMP under these Purchase Terms. If requested by the Business User from whom you purchased one or more subscriptions through an Order, Link SMP may transfer or assign such subscriptions to that Business User upon providing you notice (“**Transfer Notice**”). The Transfer Notice will state the date of the transfer or assignment of the applicable subscriptions, and any other relevant information. Unless otherwise stated in the Transfer Notice, all of our and Link SMP obligations under these Sold through Link Terms will terminate immediately on the date of the Transfer Notice.

If a Business User transfers or assigns your subscription to us and Link SMP (“**Subscription Transfer**”), then, from that Subscription Transfer date, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) your subscription with the Business User is now deemed a completed Order, (b) you authorize Link SMP to charge or debit your selected payment method for the Order on behalf of the Business User, and (c) you agree to be bound by these Sold through Link Terms.

### Buyer Services Terms

We provide services to you that enable you to manage and receive support in a single global portal for your Orders as part of your Link Account (the “**Buyer Services**”). Except as stated otherwise in these Buyer Services Terms, we provide you with post-Order services that include access to your transaction history, receipts, Order-related customer support, customer support in disputes between you and a Business User for any Order, and a process for requesting refunds.

These Buyer Services Terms are part of the Sold through Link Terms, and, along with the Consumer Terms of Service and [Link Account Terms](https://stripe.com/legal/consumer?__previewId=&__debug=#link-account-terms), apply when you use the Buyer Services through a Link Account. The Link Account Terms are incorporated in these Buyer Terms of Service by reference.

**Your Use of Buyer Services.**

You may access the Buyer Services for your Orders by signing up for Link and creating a Link Account. If you have an existing Link Account, the Buyer Services will automatically be added to your existing Link Account. If you do not have an existing Link Account, you can create a Link Account and have the option (but not the requirement) to save your payment information for an accelerated checkout experience across Link Merchants. If you elect not to save your payment information then we will not use cookies to recognize your device for an accelerated checkout experience at Link Merchant’s website. The Buyer Services only apply to Orders from Business Users selling through Link SMP.

Your access to and use of the Buyer Services does not change your relationship with the Business User, third party services or platforms, or with your bank or credit or debit card company.

**Managing your Link Account.**

Your Link Account is considered active if you have an ongoing subscription for a product that is managed through the Buyer Services. You are responsible for maintaining accurate and current information about yourself in your Link Account. You must provide to us valid and current information about yourself when requested by us or our affiliates within the time specified in the request.

**Disputes and Customer Support for Orders.**

For any disputes related to your Order, refer to the Customer Support and Returns and Refunds sections below.

**Customer Support**

For issues relating to your Order please reach out to us at [https://support.link.com/topics/sold-through-link](https://support.link.com/topics/sold-through-link). We reserve the right to redirect you to the Business User. For any issues related to use of the product you purchased in your Order please contact the Business User directly. We do not provide product-related customer support services (e.g., how to use the product).

**Returns and Refunds**

You may reach out to Customer Support to initiate a refund request. Refunds for Orders will be determined on a case by case basis and may be refused by Link SMP if there is evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other misbehavior as stated in our [refund policy](https://support.link.com/questions/sold-through-link-refunds). You should review the [Link SMP Refund Policy](https://support.link.com/questions/sold-through-link-refunds) and the refund policy of the Business User from whom you placed your Order. In the event the refund policy of the Business User you placed an Order with is more restrictive than our refund policy, our refund policy will control. Unless required by Law, we do not provide refunds for unused subscription periods or if you changed your mind about an Order.

We will assess your refund requests based on the information you provide to us. We may at times request additional information from you in relation to the Order. If you do not provide the additional information within the time as reasonably requested, your refund may be denied.

You may have additional rights as a Consumer against the Business User if products purchased through your Order are significantly not as described, faulty or not fit for purpose.

**Subscription Management**

To change, manage, or cancel a subscription that you purchased through an Order, please do so via your Link Account at link.com. You should review the Business User’s subscription policy. If you submit a request to delete your Link Account, any ongoing subscriptions that you purchased through an Order will be cancelled upon deletion of your Link Account. You are responsible for any cancellation fees or other penalties imposed by the Business User for cancellation of the subscription.
