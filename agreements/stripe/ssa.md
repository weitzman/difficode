## General Terms

Last modified: November 11, 2024

You and Stripe agree as follows:

### 1\. Your Stripe Account.

#### 1.1 Eligibility.

Only businesses (including sole proprietors) and non-profit organizations located in the United States are eligible to apply for a Stripe Account and use the Services. Stripe and its Affiliates may provide Services to you or your Affiliates in other countries or regions under separate agreements. You and your Representative must not attempt to create a Stripe Account on behalf of or for the benefit of a user whose use of the Stripe services was suspended or terminated by Stripe, unless Stripe approves otherwise.

#### 1.2 Business Representative.

You and your Representative individually affirm to Stripe that (a) your Representative is authorized to provide User Information on your behalf and to bind you to this Agreement; and (b) your Representative is an executive officer, senior manager or otherwise has significant responsibility for the control, management or direction of your business. Stripe may require you or your Representative to provide additional information or documentation demonstrating your Representative’s authority.

#### 1.3 Sole Proprietors.

If you are a sole proprietor, you and your Representative also affirm that your Representative is personally responsible and liable for your use of the Services and your obligations to Customers, including payment of amounts you owe under this Agreement.

#### 1.4 Age Requirements.

If you are a sole proprietor, and you are not old enough to enter into a contract on your own behalf (which is commonly but not always 18 years old), but you are 13 years old or older, your Representative must be your parent or legal guardian. If you are a legal entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, by an individual who is not old enough to enter into a contract on their own behalf, but the individual is 13 years old or older, your Representative must obtain the consent of either your board or an authorized officer. The approving board, authorized officer, parent or legal guardian is responsible to Stripe and is legally bound to this Agreement as if it had agreed to this Agreement itself. You must not use the Services if you are under 13 years of age.

### 2\. Services and Support.

#### 2.1 Services.

Stripe (and its Affiliates, as applicable) will make available to you the Services, including those described in the applicable Services Terms, and, if applicable, give you access to a Stripe Dashboard.

#### 2.2 Services Terms; Order of Precedence.

The Services Terms contain specific terms governing the parties’ rights and obligations related to the Services described in those Services Terms. If there are no Services Terms for a particular Stripe service, then only these General Terms govern. By accessing or using a Service, you agree to comply with the applicable Services Terms. If any term in these General Terms conflicts with a term in any Services Terms or set of terms incorporated by reference into this Agreement, then unless terms of lower precedence expressly state to the contrary, the order of precedence is: (a) the Services Terms; (b) these General Terms; and (c) all terms incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Your access to or use of the Services may also be subject to additional terms to which you agree through the Stripe Dashboard.

#### 2.3 Service Modifications and Updates.

Stripe may modify the Services and Stripe Technology at any time, including adding or removing functionality or imposing conditions on use of the Services. Stripe will notify you of material adverse changes in, deprecations to, or removal of functionality from, Services or Stripe Technology that you are using. Stripe is not obligated to provide any Updates. However, if Stripe makes an Update available, you must fully install the Update by the date or within the time period stated in Stripe’s notice; or, if there is no date or period stated in the notice, then no later than 30 days after the date of the notice.

#### 2.4 Subcontracting.

Stripe may subcontract its obligations under this Agreement to third parties.

#### 2.5 Services Restrictions.

You may only use the Services for business purposes. You must not, and must not enable or allow any third party to:

(a) use the Services for personal, family or household purposes;

(b) act as service bureau or pass-through agent for the Services with no added value to Customers;

(c) work around any of the technical limitations of the Services or enable functionality that is disabled or prohibited, or access or attempt to access non-public Stripe systems, programs, data, or services;

(d) except as Law permits, reverse engineer or attempt to reverse engineer the Services or Stripe Technology;

(e) use the Services to engage in any activity that is illegal, fraudulent, deceptive, exploitative, or harmful;

(f) perform or attempt to perform any action that interferes with the normal operation of the Services or affects other Stripe users’ use of Stripe services;

(g) exceed any Services usage limitations stated in the Documentation; or

(h) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell, or distribute in any way, any part of the Services, Documentation, or the Stripe Website except as permitted by Law.

#### 2.6 Preview Services.

(a) *Classification*. Stripe may classify certain Stripe services or Stripe Technology, including a particular product or feature release, as being in a Preview phase. A Stripe service may be generally available in some circumstances (e.g., in some countries or regions) while still released or classified as Preview in other circumstances.

(b) *Nature of Preview Services*. By their nature, Preview Services may be feature-incomplete or contain bugs. Stripe may describe limitations that exist within a Preview Service; however, your reliance on the accuracy or completeness of these descriptions is at your own risk. You should not use Preview Services in a production environment until and unless you understand and accept the limitations and flaws that may be present in the Preview Services.

(c) *Feedback*. Unless Stripe otherwise agrees in writing, your use of Preview Services is confidential, and you must provide timely Feedback on the Preview Services in response to Stripe requests.

(d) *Availability During Preview Product Release Phase*. Stripe may suspend or terminate your access to any Preview Services at any time.

#### 2.7 Support.

Stripe will provide you with support to resolve general issues relating to your Stripe Account and your use of the Services through resources and documentation that Stripe makes available on the Stripe Website and in the Documentation. Stripe’s support is also available by contacting Stripe at [contact us](https://stripe.com/contact). Stripe is not responsible for providing support to Customers.

#### 2.8 Third-Party Services.

Stripe may reference, enable you to access, or promote (including on the Stripe Website) Third-Party Services. These Third-Party Services are provided for your convenience only and Stripe does not approve, endorse, or recommend any Third-Party Services to you. **Your access and use of any Third-Party Service is at your own risk and Stripe disclaims all responsibility and liability for your use of any Third-Party Service. Third-Party Services are not Services and are not governed by this Agreement or Stripe’s Privacy Policy. Your use of any Third-Party Service, including those linked from the Stripe Website, is subject to that Third-Party Service’s own terms of use and privacy policies (if any).**

#### 2.9 Modifications to Services or Stripe Technology.

(a) *Right to Modify*. Stripe may modify or discontinue any part of a Service or Stripe Technology, including ceasing to offer that Service or Stripe Technology in a particular country. Stripe will provide you reasonable notice if the modification or discontinuation would materially reduce the functionality of a Service or Stripe Technology that you are using, unless giving notice would (i) pose a security issue to Stripe; or (ii) cause Stripe to violate Law or breach any legal obligation to a Governmental Authority or Financial Partner.

(b) *Updates*. Stripe is not obligated to provide any Updates. If Stripe does make an Update available, you must install the Update by the date or within the time period stated in Stripe’s notice; or, if there is no date or period stated in the notice, then no later than 30 days after the date of the notice.

### 3\. Information; Your Business.

#### 3.1 User Information.

Upon Stripe’s request, you must provide User Information to Stripe in a form satisfactory to Stripe. You must keep the User Information in your Stripe Account current. You must promptly update your Stripe Account with any changes affecting you, the nature of your business activities, your Representative, beneficial owners, principals, or any other pertinent information. You must immediately notify Stripe, and provide to Stripe updated User Information, if (a) you experience or anticipate experiencing a Change of Control; (b) you experience or anticipate experiencing a material change in your business or financial condition, including if you experience or are likely to experience an Insolvency Event; (c) the regulatory status of the business for which you are using the Services changes, including if it becomes subject, or no longer subject, to regulatory oversight; or (d) a Governmental Authority has notified you that you or your business is the subject of investigative action.

#### 3.2 Information Stripe Obtains.

You authorize Stripe to obtain information about you and your business from Stripe’s service providers and other third parties, including credit reporting agencies, banking partners and information bureaus, for the purposes of this Agreement. This information may include your, or your representative’s, name, addresses, credit history, banking relationships, and financial history. You must authorize and direct those third parties to compile and provide this information to Stripe.

### 4\. Services Fees; Taxes.

#### 4.1 Services Fees.

The Fees are stated on the Stripe Pricing Page, unless you and Stripe otherwise agree in writing. Subject to the requirements of Law, Stripe may revise the Fees at any time. Stripe may, from time to time, offer a Service or Service feature without charge, or waive a Fee for that Service or Service feature. If Stripe increases a Fee, or introduces a new Fee, for a Service that you are currently using, then Stripe will notify you at least 30 days (or longer period if Law requires) before the revised or new Fee applies to you.

#### 4.2 Collection of Fees and Other Amounts.

You must pay, or ensure that Stripe is able to collect, Fees, Taxes, and other amounts you owe under this Agreement when due. Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff Fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreements you have with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, from your Stripe Account balance, or invoice you for those amounts. If you fail to pay invoiced amounts when due, if your Stripe Account balance is negative or does not contain funds sufficient to pay amounts that you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreement with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, or if Stripe is unable to collect amounts due from your Stripe Account balance, then Stripe may, to the extent Law permits, deduct, recoup or setoff those amounts from: (a) if established and applicable, each Reserve; (b) funds payable by Stripe or its Affiliate to you or your Affiliate; (c) if established, each User Affiliate Reserve; (d) each User Bank Account; and (e) the Stripe account balance of each Stripe account that Stripe determines, acting reasonably, is associated with you or your Affiliate. If the currency of the amount being deducted is different from the currency of the amount you owe, Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff an amount equal to the amount owed (using Stripe’s conversion rate) together with any fees Stripe incurs in making the conversion.

#### 4.3 Debit Authorization.

Without limiting Section 4.2 of these General Terms, you authorize Stripe to debit each User Bank Account without separate notice, and according to the applicable [User Bank Account Debit Authorization](https://stripe.com/legal/bank-debit-authorizations), to collect amounts you owe under this Agreement. If Stripe is unable to collect those amounts by debiting a User Bank Account, then you immediately grant to Stripe a new, original authorization to debit each User Bank Account without notice and according to the applicable [User Bank Account Debit Authorization](https://stripe.com/legal/bank-debit-authorizations). Stripe may rely on this authorization to make one or more attempts to collect all or a subset of the amounts owed. Your authorization under this Section 4.3 will remain in full force and effect until (a) all of your Stripe Accounts are closed; or (b) all fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement are paid, whichever occurs later. If applicable debit scheme authorization rules grant you the right to revoke your debit authorization, then to the extent Law permits, you waive that right.

#### 4.4 Taxes.

The Fees exclude all Taxes, except as the Stripe Pricing Page expressly states to the contrary. You have sole responsibility and liability for:

(a) determining which, if any, Taxes or fees apply to the sale of your products and services, acceptance of donations, or payments you make or receive in connection with your use of the Services; and

(b) assessing, collecting, reporting and remitting Taxes for your business.

If Stripe is required by Law to collect or withhold any Taxes, Stripe may deduct those Taxes from amounts otherwise owed to you and pay those Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. If you are exempt from paying, or are otherwise eligible to pay a reduced rate on, those Taxes, you may provide to Stripe an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to your tax-exempt status or reduced rate eligibility, in which case Stripe will not deduct the Taxes that certificate covers. You must provide accurate information regarding your tax affairs as Stripe reasonably requests, and must promptly notify Stripe if any information that Stripe prepopulates is inaccurate or incomplete. Stripe may send documents to you and taxing authorities for transactions processed using the Services. Specifically, Law may require Stripe to file periodic informational returns with taxing authorities related to your use of the Services. Stripe may send tax-related information electronically to you.

### 5\. User Bank Accounts; Funds.

#### 5.1 User Bank Accounts; Prohibition on Grant or Assignment.

You must designate at least one User Bank Account in connection with the Services. Stripe may debit and credit a User Bank Account as described in this Agreement. You must not grant or assign to any third party any lien on or interest in funds that may be owed to you under this Agreement until the funds are deposited into a User Bank Account.

#### 5.2 Holding of Funds.

To the extent Law and the applicable Financial Services Terms permit, Stripe and its Affiliates may invest funds they hold into liquid investments. Stripe or its applicable Affiliates will (a) hold these investments separate from investments made with their own funds; and (b) own, and User will not receive, any earnings from these investments. Stripe's and its Affiliates' investment of funds will not affect or delay Stripe's payout obligations under this Agreement.

#### 5.3 Regulated Money Transmission; Stripe Status.

Certain Services involve regulated money transmission under U.S. Law. To the extent that your use of the Services involves money transmission or other regulated services under U.S. Law, Stripe’s Affiliate, SPC, provides those regulated Services, and the SPC terms located on or accessible from the Stripe Legal Page will apply to you, unless the applicable Services Terms specify otherwise. Stripe is not a bank, and does not accept deposits.

#### 5.4 Dormant Accounts.

If you leave any funds dormant in a Stripe Account and you do not instruct Stripe on where to send them, Stripe may deem the funds abandoned by you and deliver them to the appropriate Governmental Authority. However, if Law requires, Stripe will attempt to notify you before doing so.

#### 5.5 Assessed Fines.

You (a) are responsible for all Assessed Fines; and (b) must reimburse Stripe for its payment of Assessed Fines, except to the extent the Assessed Fines result from Stripe’s (i) breach of Law, the Agreement, or Financial Services Terms; or (ii) negligence.

### 6\. Termination; Suspension; Survival.

(c) *Termination for Material Breach*. A party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement, and if capable of cure, does not cure the breach within 10 days after receiving notice specifying the breach.

#### 13.2 Binding Arbitration.

(a) All disputes, claims and controversies, whether based on past, present or future events, arising out of or relating to statutory or common law claims, the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of any provision of this Agreement, and the determination of the scope or applicability of your agreement to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy originating from this Agreement, but specifically excluding any dispute principally related to either party’s IP Rights (which will be resolved in litigation before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California), will be determined by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California before a single arbitrator.

The Expedited Procedures of the American Arbitration Association’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply for cases in which no disclosed claim or counterclaim exceeds $75,000 USD (excluding interest, attorneys’ fees and arbitration fees and costs).

(c) The arbitrator will apply the substantive law of the State of California and of the United States, excluding their conflict or choice of law rules.

Notwithstanding the provisions in this Section 13 referencing applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16) will govern any arbitration conducted in accordance with this Agreement.

#### 13.3 Arbitration Procedure.

(a) A party must notify the other party of its intent to commence arbitration prior to commencing arbitration. The notice must specify the date on which the arbitration demand is intended to be filed, which must be at least 30 days after the date of the notice. During this time period, the parties will meet for the purpose of resolving the dispute prior to commencing arbitration.

(b) Subject to Section 13.3(a) of these General Terms, each party may commence arbitration by providing to the American Arbitration Association and the other party to the dispute a written demand for arbitration, stating the subject of the dispute and the relief requested.

(c) Subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability stated in this Agreement, the appointed arbitrators may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the laws of the State of California. In making a determination, the arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any term of this Agreement. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned, written decision with respect to the dispute to each party, who will promptly act in accordance with the arbitrator’s decision. Any award (including interim or final remedies) may be confirmed in or enforced by a state or federal court located in San Francisco, California. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, and will not be subject to appeal or review.

(d) In accordance with the AAA Rules, the party initiating the arbitration is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. Each party will advance one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the costs of the attendance of the arbitration reporter at the arbitration hearing, and the costs of the arbitration facility. In any arbitration arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the arbitrator will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and legal fees awards will be offset.

#### 13.5 Conflict of Rules.

In the case of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 13 and the AAA Rules, the provisions of this Section 13 will prevail.

#### 13.6 Class Waiver.

To the extent Law permits, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this class waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither party is entitled to arbitration.

#### 13.7 No Jury Trial.

If for any reason a claim or dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated between the parties.

You are solely responsible for providing support to Customers regarding Transaction receipts, product or service delivery, support, returns, refunds, and all other issues related to your goods and services and business activities.

#### 3.10 Stripe Radar; Your Responsibility for Transactions.

The Stripe Radar Services may be enabled by default and are governed by the Stripe Radar Terms. If you do not wish to use the Stripe Radar Services in connection with Stripe Payments Services, you must [contact Stripe support](https://stripe.com/contact) to disable it. You are solely responsible for all losses you and the Stripe Parties incur due to erroneous and fraudulent Transactions that occur in connection with your use of the Services, including as a result of (a) lost or stolen payment credentials or the details of any accounts that are used to purchase goods or services from you; (b) any changes to the User Bank Accounts; and (c) any unauthorized use of, or access or modification to, your Stripe Account.

### 4\. Processing Transactions.

#### 4.1 Payment Authorization Requests.

(a) *Processing Transactions.* To enable Stripe to process Transactions for you, you authorize and direct Stripe, its Affiliates, Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers to receive and settle, as applicable, settlement funds owed to you through your use of the Stripe Payments Services. You may only submit Transactions that Customers authorize, and only after the applicable goods have been shipped or services provided to the Customer; except, you may submit a Transaction before goods have been shipped or services have been provided to the Customer where the Customer has authorized a Transaction for a partial or full prepayment for goods or services to be provided at a future time, or you have obtained the Customer’s consent.

(b) *Transaction Responsibility*. You must not proceed with a Transaction if (i) you know or should have known that the Transaction was fraudulent, not authorized by the Customer, or illegal in your or your Customer’s jurisdiction; (ii) you receive a response declining to authorize the Transaction; or (iii) the Customer’s ability to use a Payment Method has expired or is no longer valid. You must not split payment for a single transaction into multiple Transactions except as the Payment Method Rules, Payment Method Terms and Acquirer Terms expressly permit. You must not submit any Transaction that duplicates a Transaction that is already subject to a Dispute, or was previously disputed and subsequently resolved in your favor. Stripe may refuse to process, or condition or suspend any Transaction that Stripe believes (x) may violate this Agreement or other agreement you have with Stripe (if any); (y) is unauthorized, fraudulent or illegal; or (z) exposes, or is likely to expose, Stripe, you or others to unacceptable risk.

#### 4.2 Pooled Accounts.

You appoint Stripe and Stripe’s Affiliate, SPC, as your agents for the limited purpose of directing, receiving, holding and settling funds under this Agreement. All settlement funds Stripe or, as applicable, SPC receives for Transactions are combined with settlement funds for other users and held in one or more Pooled Accounts at one or more Financial Partners. Once Stripe or SPC (as applicable) receives funds for a Transaction on your behalf, the relevant Customer has no further obligation to make payments to you with respect to that Transaction, regardless of whether and when Stripe or SPC (as applicable) settles those funds to you. If Stripe or SPC (as applicable) does not settle funds due to you under this Agreement, you will have recourse only against Stripe or SPC (as applicable) and not the relevant Customer. Stripe will promptly update your Stripe Account balance to reflect processed Transactions. If, in the capacity as your agent, Stripe or its Affiliate provide a receipt for a Transaction to the applicable Customer, that receipt is binding on you. Stripe and its Affiliates (as applicable) may invest funds held in a Pooled Account as described in Section 5.2 of the General Terms. You have no rights to any Pooled Account, or earnings generated by funds held in any Pooled Account, and are not entitled to draw funds from any Pooled Account.

#### 4.3 Transaction Settlement Funds.

Stripe will transfer settlement funds for Transactions, net of Fees, Disputes, Refunds, Reversals and other amounts owed to Stripe, from the applicable Pooled Account to the applicable User Bank Account within the time period stated in the Payout Schedule, unless a Payout Delay occurs and affects the transfer initiation, or Stripe exercises a right under this Agreement to withhold or delay the transfer. However, Stripe may impose an additional holding period before making the initial settlement to a User Bank Account.

#### 4.4 Sending Funds to Third-Party Recipients.

Stripe may offer you the ability to send to a third party funds owed to you as you instruct Stripe (including by sending all or part of the positive balance in your Stripe Account to that third-party recipient’s Stripe account or bank account), instead of settling funds to a User Bank Account. If Stripe or SPC sends funds to a third-party recipient which may include the use of a payment intermediary operating on your behalf, as this Section 4.4 contemplates, then Stripe’s and SPC’s obligations (and all applicable Payment Method Provider and Payment Method Acquirer obligations) to settle those funds to you are satisfied.

#### 4.5 Settlement Fees.

Stripe is not responsible for any fees imposed by banks to which Stripe transfers funds, including the banks that hold the User Bank Accounts and the third-party recipient accounts.

#### 4.6 Subscriptions and Invoicing.

If you use the Services to submit recurring or subscription Transactions, then before submitting the initial Transaction, you must (a) inform each Customer that the relevant Transactions will occur on an ongoing basis; and (b) explain the method for canceling the Customer’s recurring billing or subscription. If you use the Services to issue invoices to Customers, you must ensure that the form and content of the invoices comply with Law and are sufficient to achieve the legal or tax effects that you are trying to achieve.

#### 4.7 Customer Authorizations.

If you use the Stripe Payments Services for certain Transactions where the Customer is not present, including MOTO Transactions or Merchant Initiated Transactions, or to store a Customer’s Payment Method for future use, you may be required by Law and Payment Method Rules to obtain the Customer’s authorization (also known as a mandate or agreement for the provision of products or services) and make certain disclosures to the Customer. These disclosures may include when, and under what circumstances, the Customer’s Payment Method will be charged, how the payment amount will be determined, and how future payments can be canceled. You must retain, and provide to Stripe upon request, records demonstrating that you have (a) obtained any required Customer authorizations in compliance with Law and Payment Method Rules; and (b) only submitted Transactions as MOTO Transactions or Merchant Initiated Transactions that you have determined are eligible.

### 5\. Actions Stripe May Take in Processing Transactions.

#### 5.1 Reconciliation and Responsibility.

As between the parties, and except as required by Law, you are responsible for reviewing your Transaction history for accuracy and completeness and reconciling your Transaction history with the history of transfers from the Pooled Accounts to the User Bank Accounts. If you find an error when you reconcile your Transaction history, Stripe will reasonably cooperate with you to investigate and help correct that error as long as you notify Stripe of the error within 60 days after the error appears in your Transaction history. Stripe may correct any errors in your Transaction history by crediting or debiting the User Bank Accounts.

#### 5.2 Negative Balances.

If your Stripe Account balance (or the Stripe Account balance of any User Entity) is negative, or does not contain funds sufficient to pay amounts that you (or a User Entity) owe to a Stripe Entity or Customers, then without limiting Stripe’s rights under Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the General Terms, Stripe may debit the User Bank Accounts by the amount necessary to collect, and pay out to Customers if applicable, the amounts you owe.

#### 5.3 Disputes; Refunds; Reversals.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, you are liable to Stripe for the full amount of all Disputes (unless and until a Dispute is resolved to final disposition in your favor according to applicable Payment Method Rules and as described in the Documentation), Refunds and Reversals regardless of the reason or timing.

(a) *Disputes*. Stripe may delay or withhold paying out a Transaction amount from funds owed to you if Stripe reasonably believes that a Dispute is likely to occur with respect to that Transaction. Stripe may delay or withhold paying out amounts subject to an actual Dispute until the Payment Method Provider resolves the Dispute.

(b) *Refunds*. If you intend to issue a Refund to a Customer, you must initiate a Refund instruction via the Services within 5 days after informing the Customer of your intention. Stripe may refuse to act upon a Refund instruction, or delay executing the instruction, if you are the subject of an Insolvency Event, if it would cause a negative balance in your Stripe Account, or if Stripe believes that there is a risk you will not meet your liabilities under this Agreement.

(c) *Reversals*. Without limiting Stripe’s rights under Sections 5.4 - 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms, Stripe may initiate a Reversal if:

(i) the Payment Method Provider invalidates the Transaction;

(ii) you receive funds in error for any reason;

(iii) you were not authorized to accept the Transaction;

(iv) you receive funds related to activities that violate this Agreement, Law or Financial Services Terms; or

(v) a Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer requires Stripe to do so under the applicable Financial Services Terms.

#### 5.4 Stripe Remedies – Specific Triggers.

Stripe may exercise any or all of the remedies stated in Section 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms if Stripe determines that a User Entity:

(a) has incurred or is likely to incur excessive Disputes, Refunds or Reversals;

(b) has submitted one or more Transactions for goods or services not immediately deliverable to the Customer without first obtaining Stripe’s consent;

(c) has a negative Stripe Account balance;

(d) has experienced or is likely to experience a change in the average time between the initial charge and fulfillment of Customer orders that Stripe considers to be material;

(e) is or is likely to become the subject of an Insolvency Event;

(f) has experienced or is likely to experience a deterioration of its business or financial condition that Stripe considers to be material;

(g) has breached or is likely to breach, or has caused or is likely to cause Stripe to breach, this Agreement (or any other Stripe services agreement with a Stripe Entity) or the Financial Services Terms applicable to the User Entity’s use of the Services;

(h) has violated or is likely to violate Law or Financial Services Terms;

(i) has caused or is likely to cause Stripe to violate Law or Financial Services Terms;

(j) has experienced or is likely to experience a Change of Control;

(k) has, either itself or by way of its employees, agents, directors or contractors, initiated Transactions or undertaken any other action that is or is likely to be fraudulent, suspicious or involve criminal activity;

(l) has, without Stripe’s prior consent, changed its business model (including services supplied by a User Entity to its customers), exposing Stripe to increased risk; or

(m) has acted in a manner or engaged in business, trading practice or other activity that presents an unacceptable risk.

#### 5.5 Stripe Remedies – General Trigger.

Stripe may exercise any or all of the remedies stated in Section 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms if (a) Stripe reasonably determines that Stripe may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, criminal activity or other risks associated with a User Entity after these Stripe Payments Terms terminate; or (b) Law requires.

#### 5.6 Stripe Remedies – Scope.

Stripe may, in accordance with Sections 5.4 and 5.5 of these Stripe Payments Terms:

(a) initiate Reversals;

(b) change the Payout Schedule or delay or cancel the payout of funds to the User Bank Accounts;

(c) establish, fund and use a Reserve;

(d) debit the User Bank Accounts or the bank or financial institution accounts of any or all User Entities;

(e) suspend or terminate your ability to accept or process Transactions;

(f) refuse to (i) process Transactions, and (ii) act upon Refund instructions; and

(g) setoff or recoup all liability that Stripe reasonably determines a User Entity owes to a Stripe Entity under this Agreement or another agreement, against any amounts that a Stripe Entity, owes to a User Entity whether the liability is matured, unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated.

#### 5.7 Reserve.

If Stripe establishes a Reserve, Stripe will notify you of the Reserve terms. Stripe may change the Reserve terms (a) if Stripe believes that there is, or is likely to be, a change in the underlying risk presented by the User Group’s use of Stripe services; or (b) as a Payment Method Acquirer or Payment Method Provider requires. You have no legal or equitable right or interest in any Reserve, in the funds held in any Reserve, or earnings generated by funds held in any Reserve, and are not entitled to draw funds from any Reserve. If you become subject to an Insolvency Event, funds held in a Reserve will not be part of any estate created in connection with that Insolvency Event. Stripe may fund the Reserve through any or all of:

(i) using funds you provide upon Stripe’s request;

(ii) using funds that a Stripe Entity owes to any User Entity for Transactions that the User Group accepts through the Stripe Payments Services; or

(iii) debiting the User Bank Accounts or the bank or financial institution accounts of any or all User Entities.

#### 5.8 Security Interest.

You grant Stripe a lien on and security interest in your interest, if any, in (a) all funds owed to you for Transactions (including funds owed to you for future Transactions and all funds that Stripe holds on your behalf); and (b) all rights to receive credits and payments under this Agreement. You must execute all documents and provide all authorizations that Stripe reasonably requests for the purpose of creating, perfecting (including filing relevant documents), maintaining and enforcing this lien and security interest, even if the request is made after your Stripe Account balance becomes negative.

#### 5.9 Credit Support Requirement.

Stripe may require that you provide a guarantee (including a personal, parent or bank guarantee) or letter of credit in a form and substance that satisfies Stripe. In this event, Stripe will inform you of the amount of and the reasons for the requirement. If you are unable to satisfy the requirement when Stripe requires you to do so, Stripe may suspend or terminate your access to the Services.

### 6\. Multi-Currency Processing.

Stripe may offer Multi-Currency Processing. To use Multi-Currency Processing, you must provide to Stripe a valid bank account for each currency for which you request settlement, based on the list of available settlement currencies stated in the Documentation. Each of these bank accounts is a User Bank Account for the purposes of this Agreement. If you use Multi-Currency Processing, Stripe will identify at the time of each applicable Transaction the conversion rate that will apply to the Transaction. In the event of a Refund, the conversion rate that will be used to calculate the Refund will be the rate in effect at the time of the Refund.

### 7\. Post-Termination Obligations.

#### 7.1 Completion of Transactions.

Following termination of these Stripe Payments Terms, you must fulfill your obligations related to existing Transactions, not accept new Transactions via the Services, and remove all Marks of a Stripe Entity or a Financial Partner from your website (unless permitted under a separate license with the applicable Financial Partner). Stripe will complete Transactions initiated before termination as long as Stripe would have completed those Transactions were these Stripe Payments Terms still in place (e.g., Stripe will not complete a Transaction if a Financial Partner prohibits Stripe from doing so). Termination does not affect your responsibility for Transactions described in Section 3 of these Stripe Payments Terms.

#### 7.2 Provision of Payment Account Details.

If these Stripe Payments Terms terminate for reasons other than your breach, then within 30 days after the termination date, you may request in writing that Stripe provide all relevant Payment Account Details to an alternative PCI-DSS Level 1-certified payment processor that you identify to Stripe. Stripe will provide the Payment Account Details that you are entitled to receive to the named payment processor to the extent commercially reasonable. Stripe may delay or refuse any request if Stripe believes the payment processor you have identified does not have systems or controls in place that are sufficient to protect Payment Account Details, that the integrity of Payment Account Details may be compromised, or that Law or Financial Services Terms do not allow Stripe to provide the Payment Account Details.

### 8\. User Information Updates.

You must immediately notify Stripe, and provide to Stripe updated User Information, if you experience or anticipate experiencing a material change in the average time between the initial charge and fulfillment of Customer orders. Upon request, you must promptly provide to Stripe information related to Transactions and Disputes, including (a) refund and shipping policies (if applicable); (b) data on captured but unfulfilled charges; and (c) data on the time between charge capture and fulfillment of Customer orders.

### 9\. PCI Standards Compliance.

If you elect to store or hold "Account Data," as defined in the PCI Standards (including Customer card account number or expiration date), you must maintain a system that complies with the PCI Standards and upon Stripe’s request, you must provide to Stripe evidence of your compliance. If you do not comply with the PCI Standards, or if Stripe or any Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer is unable to verify your compliance with the PCI Standards, Stripe may suspend your Stripe Account or terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part. If you intend to use a third-party service provider to store or transmit Payment Account Details (including Customer card account number and expiration date) then you must not share any Payment Account Details with the service provider until you verify that the third party holds sufficient certifications under the PCI Standards, and must [notify Stripe](https://stripe.com/contact) of your intention to share Payment Account Details with the service provider. Further, you agree to never store or hold any "Sensitive Authentication Data," as defined by the PCI Standards (including the card verification value or similar security code), at any time. You can find information about the PCI Standards on the [PCI Council’s website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).

### 10\. Representations and Warranties.

You represent as of the Effective Date, and warrant during the Term, that (a) you only use the Payment Methods and Stripe Payments Services for bona fide commercial transactions (which must be free of liens, claims, and encumbrances other than ordinary sales taxes) for the sale of goods or services to, or other act with, Customers; (b) except as Stripe approves, you do not use the Stripe Payments Services for intercompany transactions; (c) you fulfill all of your obligations to Customers; and (d) you and your third-party service providers that store, access or transmit Payment Account Details comply with the PCI Standards, as applicable.

### 11\. Fraudulent Transactions.

As between the parties, you are responsible for all (a) losses, damages, and costs Stripe and its Affiliates incur due to fraudulent Transactions, and the limitations on liability in Section 12.2 of the SSA do not apply; and (b) costs associated with any Financial Partner-initiated audit or forensic investigation arising out of or relating to your use of the Stripe Payments Services.

### 12\. Liability for Failure to Transfer Funds.

The limitation of liability in Section 12.2(b) of the General Terms will not apply to claims you or your Affiliates make against the Stripe Parties for failing to transfer any settlement funds the Stripe Parties receive and owe to you in connection with the Stripe Payments Services. For these claims, the Stripe Parties’ liability is limited to the amount that the Stripe Parties have received and owe, but failed to transfer, to you.

### Stripe Connect - Platform

Last modified: November 11, 2024

### 1\. Stripe Connect Services.

These terms (“**Stripe Connect Terms**”) supplement the General Terms and the Stripe Payments Terms and govern your use of the Stripe Connect Services as a Stripe Connect Platform. You may use the Stripe Connect Services to (a) enable your Platform Users to use the Services in conjunction with your Platform Services; and (b) make payouts to Payout Recipients.

### 2\. Stripe Obligations.

#### 2.1 Connected Accounts.

Connected Accounts may use the Services in accordance with the Connected Account Agreement. Stripe may suspend or stop providing any Services to (a) a Payout Recipient for any reason; and (b) all other Connected Accounts in accordance with the terms of the Connected Account Agreement. Except for Connected Accounts that are Payout Recipients, Stripe has a direct contractual relationship with each Connected Account under the Connected Account Agreement and will provide the Services directly to each Connected Account. You acknowledge that Connected Accounts may choose to use Stripe services outside of the Connected Accounts’ relationship with you.

#### 2.2 Amendments to Connected Account Agreement.

For Custom Accounts, Express Accounts and all other Connected Accounts that do not have a Stripe Dashboard, Stripe will notify you if Stripe modifies the relevant Connected Account Agreement. You must notify those Connected Accounts (excluding Payout Recipients) of the modification promptly after you receive the modification notice from Stripe.

#### 2.3 Definitions Applied to Connected Accounts; General Terms Clarification.

Where defined terms are applied to a Connected Account (rather than you) in these terms, the relevant definition will be deemed to reference the Connected Account (e.g., when the term Services is applied to a Connected Account it means the Stripe services that Stripe makes available to the Connected Account under the Connected Account Agreement, and when the term Disputes is applied to a Connected Account it means Disputes that Connected Account incurs). Connected Accounts are not third parties for the purposes of, or eligible to make a Claim under, Section 11 of the General Terms.

### 3\. Your Obligations.

#### 3.1 Stripe Connect Services Integration and Use.

You must integrate the Stripe API and use the Stripe Connect Services in accordance with the Documentation and this Agreement. You must use the Stripe Connect Services and Connected Account Data in accordance with Law and your Platform Provider Agreement. You must clearly and prominently disclose all Platform Fees, if any, and, to the extent charged separately, the Services.

#### 3.2 Connected Accounts and Transactional Risk.

You must ensure that Connected Accounts do not use the Services in breach of the Connected Account Agreement or for any activity that Law or this Agreement prohibits. You must immediately inform Stripe if you become aware that a Connected Account is engaging in any activity that is fraudulent, deceptive or harmful, or in breach of the Connected Account Agreement or this Agreement. You must cooperate with Stripe to reduce the risk of fraud or other misuse of the Services, including by providing relevant information to Stripe.

#### 3.3 Prohibited and Restricted Businesses.

You must ensure that no Connected Account uses the Services to conduct a Prohibited or Restricted Business or transact with a Prohibited or Restricted Business.

#### 3.4 Activity.

A Connected Account may perform Activity, or you may perform Activity on behalf of a Connected Account, depending on how you integrate the Stripe API into your Platform Services. You are responsible for all Activity initiated by you, your representatives, and any individual or entity using your credentials, including your Stripe Account login and password and your Stripe API key. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, where either Stripe or a Connected Account incurs any losses, damages or costs based on unauthorized Activity initiated by you or on your behalf, then as between Stripe and you, you are liable for those losses, damages or costs.

#### 3.5 Your Agreements with Connected Accounts.

Your Platform Provider Agreement must explain how you access and use Connected Account Data, and the Activity that you may conduct on the Connected Accounts’ behalf via the Stripe Connect Services. Your Platform Provider Agreement must also authorize you to perform that Activity, and to share the Connected Account Data with Stripe.

#### 3.6 Limitations.

You must not use the Stripe Connect Services to access any Connected Account Data or conduct any Activity, or attempt to do either, for which the relevant Connected Account has not authorized, or has withdrawn the authorization.

### 4\. Stripe Connected Account Options.

#### 4.1 Platform Account Options.

You may elect to enroll each Platform User as (a) one of Stripe's named Connected Account types: Standard Account, Custom Account or Express Account; or (b) a Connected Account with a distinct combination of attributes (e.g., onboarding experience and dashboard user interfaces, Merchant Loss risk management and pricing controls), as described in the Documentation. Depending on your enrollment election, you may (a) assist your Platform Users in creating Stripe accounts or integrating their existing Stripe accounts into your Platform Services; and (b) provide Connected Account Data to Stripe during the enrollment process. Section 8 of the General Terms applies to all Connected Account Data that you provide to Stripe. Stripe may refuse to create a Stripe account for a Platform User or limit the functionality available to a Platform User until Stripe is satisfied that it has received sufficient information about that Platform User.

#### 4.2 Attribute-Based Connected Accounts.

This Section 4.2 only applies to Connected Accounts that are enrolled with a distinct combination of attributes (i.e., not Standard Accounts, Custom Accounts or Express Accounts).

(a) *Enrollment.* You must create and manage the Stripe accounts for these Connected Accounts. You must ensure that Connected Account Data is provided to Stripe in the manner prescribed in the Documentation, and that Connected Accounts without Platform Pricing Control have access to the Stripe Dashboard.

(b) *Connected Account Agreement.* You must ensure that each Platform User that you intend to onboard as one of these Connected Accounts agrees to the Connected Account Agreement before it uses any Stripe services. You may surface the Connected Account Agreement either through a Stripe-powered onboarding flow (e.g., embedded, Stripe-hosted or Stripe-assisted onboarding), or through your own onboarding flow. At Stripe’s request, you must provide proof as Stripe requires that these agreements have been entered into between the Connected Accounts and Stripe. If Stripe believes that your existing acceptance process does not create a binding agreement between Stripe and each Connected Account, then, upon Stripe’s request, you must modify that process as Stripe requires.

(c) *Responsibility for Connected Accounts.* As between Stripe and you, you are responsible for all Activity on these Connected Accounts, whether initiated by you or not, and are liable to Stripe for all resulting Merchant Losses (except with respect to SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts to the extent stated in Section 5.2 below) and any other losses, damages, and costs that result from use of the Services, including any fines assessed by Financial Partners or Governmental Authorities, except to the extent the losses, damages, or costs arise from Stripe’s breach of this Agreement or Stripe’s negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud. You remain jointly and severally liable with these Connected Accounts to Stripe for these amounts, and Stripe may collect these amounts from you in accordance with the Agreement.

#### 4.3 Standard Accounts.

This Section 4.3 only applies to Standard Accounts.

(a) *Enrollment.* For Standard Accounts, you will have access to certain Connected Account Data. Stripe may require you to collect and provide additional Connected Account Data to validate a Standard Account.

(b) *Termination.* A Standard Account may at any time terminate your ability to conduct Activity on its Stripe account.

#### 4.4 Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.

This Section 4.4 only applies to Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.

(a) *Enrollment.* You must create and manage the Stripe accounts for Custom Accounts and Express Accounts. You must ensure that Connected Account Data is passed to Stripe in the manner prescribed in the Documentation.

(b) *Connected Account Agreement for Custom Accounts.* You must ensure that each Platform User that you intend to onboard as a Custom Account agrees to the Connected Account Agreement before it uses any Stripe services. At Stripe’s request, you must provide proof as Stripe requires that these agreements have been entered into between the Custom Accounts and Stripe. If Stripe believes that your existing acceptance process does not create a binding agreement between Stripe and each Custom Account, then, upon Stripe’s request, you must modify that process as Stripe requires.

(c) *Stripe Dashboard.* Custom Accounts will not have access to a Stripe Dashboard.

(d) *Responsibility for Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.* You are responsible and liable to Stripe for all Activity on Custom Accounts and Express Accounts, whether initiated by you or not, including all Transactions, Disputes, Refunds, Reversals, associated fines, and any use of the Services in a manner prohibited under this Agreement or the Connected Account Agreement. You and the relevant Connected Account are jointly and severally liable to Stripe for amounts the Connected Account owes to Stripe, and Stripe may collect these amounts from you in accordance with this Agreement. If Stripe determines that your responsibility for Activity on Custom Accounts and Express Accounts creates an unacceptable risk to Stripe, Stripe may exercise its remedies listed in Section 5.6 of the Stripe Payments Terms.

#### 4.5 Payout Recipients.

Stripe may enable you to make payouts to Payout Recipients. For the purpose of these payouts, Stripe does not provide any service directly to the Payout Recipients, and the Payout Recipients do not have a contractual or business relationship with Stripe. To the extent Stripe makes payouts to Payout Recipients, it does so on your behalf. To receive these payouts, Payout Recipients will not enter into a Connected Account Agreement and that concept, as used in these Stripe Connect Terms, will not apply to Connected Accounts that are Payout Recipients. You must complete a Stripe account application for each Payout Recipient and enroll them as a Custom Account or an Express Account. Each Payout Recipient is subject to Stripe’s approval. You must ensure that each Payout Recipient receives the Stripe Recipient Notice before you make a payout to the Payout Recipient. By making payouts to Payout Recipients, you are using Stripe Payments Services.

### 5\. Stripe Managed Risk Services.

#### 5.1 Requirements for Using Stripe Managed Risk Services.

(a) *Enrollment.* When using Stripe Managed Risk Services, all your Connected Accounts must be SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts, except (i) as Stripe expressly approves in writing signed by the parties or as is otherwise permitted in the Documentation; (ii) when you are transitioning pre-existing Platform Users from Connected Account types that do not enable Stripe Managed Risk Services to SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts, which you must do within a reasonable time period and in accordance with the Documentation; and (iii) during the Post-SMR Transition Period.

(b) *Required Stripe Technology.* You must use all applicable Stripe Technology that Stripe requires for using Stripe Managed Risk Services as described in the Documentation (e.g., Stripe-powered onboarding and interfaces). Stripe will enable Stripe Radar Services on all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts by default, and you must not disable these Services. The Fees for Stripe Radar Services are not included in the Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees.

#### 5.2 Liability for Merchant Losses.

As between you and Stripe, Stripe is liable for Merchant Losses on an SMR-Enabled Connected Account up to the amount of the risk cap, if any is expressly agreed on by the parties, except (a) as stated in Section 5.5; and (b) to the extent these Merchant Losses arise from your fraud, violation of Law, breach of the Agreement (including these Stripe Connect Terms), negligence, willful misconduct, or misuse of the Stripe Connect Services. The limitations on liability in Section 12 of the General Terms will not apply with respect to Stripe’s liability for Merchant Losses under this Section 5.2.

#### 5.3 Changes in Risk Profile.

Stripe determines the Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees based on the risk profile Stripe associates with your Connected Accounts. If Stripe determines that the risk profile of your SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts changes significantly, then Stripe may revise the Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees. Stripe will notify you at least 30 days (or a longer period if Law requires) before the revised Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees apply to you.

#### 5.4 Transitioning Off Stripe Managed Risk Services.

To transition off Stripe Managed Risk Services, you must either permanently stop using Stripe Connect Services with respect to all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts, or migrate all payments volume from SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts to Connected Account types that do not enable Stripe Managed Risk Services within a reasonable time period. Stripe Managed Risk Services Fees will continue to apply for all Transactions on SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts during and after the Post-SMR Transition Period.

#### 5.5 Liability for Merchant Losses During Post-SMR Transition Period.

You and the relevant Platform User become jointly and severally liable to Stripe for all Merchant Losses on all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts associated with a Platform User from when you initiate the first Transaction for that Platform User on a Connected Account type that does not enable Stripe Managed Risk Services. Stripe may collect these amounts according to the Agreement and the Connected Account Agreement, as applicable, including Merchant Losses that arise during the Post-SMR Transition Period resulting from Activity that occurred before the Post-SMR Transition Period. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, Stripe’s aggregate liability for Merchant Losses on all SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts during the Post-SMR Transition Period will not exceed the amount of the General Damages cap stated in Section 12 of the General Terms. Stripe’s liability for Merchant Losses on SMR-Enabled Connected Accounts ends at the end of the Post-SMR Transition Period.

### 6\. Tax Reporting; Tax Invoicing.

#### 6.1 Filing of Tax Information Reports.

Unless Stripe notifies you otherwise, Stripe will not file any, and you assume sole responsibility and liability for filing all, Tax Information Reports required to be filed as a result of Services Stripe provides to you under this Agreement or to Connected Accounts under their Connected Account Agreement. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, if applicable, Stripe will file Tax Information Reports with respect to payments made to Standard Accounts, and for Transactions on Connected Accounts that do not have Platform Pricing Control.

#### 6.2 Indemnity.

You will indemnify Stripe from all Taxes, and related interest, penalties and fees (excluding any income, franchise or similar taxes payable with respect to the Fees), if any, imposed on a Stripe Entity as a result of your failure to timely file any Tax Information Report under Section 6.1 of these Stripe Connect Terms.

#### 6.3 Issuing Tax Forms.

When Stripe files Tax Information Reports as stated in Section 6.1, Stripe will issue Tax Information Reports (if applicable) directly to the Connected Accounts. For Custom Accounts and Express Accounts, and for Transactions on Connected Accounts that have Platform Pricing Control, Stripe will issue Tax Information Reports (if applicable) directly to you only.

#### 6.4 Tax Invoices.

(a) *Standard Accounts, Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.* For Standard Accounts, Stripe will issue Tax invoices, as applicable, to: (i) you under these Stripe Connect Terms; (ii) Standard Accounts under their Connected Account Agreement; or (iii) both you and the Standard Accounts. For Custom Accounts and Express Accounts, Stripe will issue Tax invoices (if applicable) to you only.

(b) *All Other Connected Accounts.* For all other Connected Accounts, you and Stripe agree (i) for each Transaction on Connected Accounts that do not have Platform Pricing Control, Stripe is providing its Services to the Connected Accounts and will issue Tax invoices directly to the Connected Accounts only; and (ii) for each Transaction on Connected Accounts that have Platform Pricing Control, Stripe is providing its Services to you and will issue Tax invoices directly to you only, and you will be treated as making separate taxable supplies to your Connected Accounts for purposes of this section.

### 7\. IRS Form 1099 Services.

#### 7.1 IRS Form 1099 Services.

You may use the IRS Form 1099 Services to generate copies of IRS Form 1099 and deliver them to the applicable Governmental Authorities, as described in the Documentation.

#### 7.2 Disclaimer.

When using IRS Form 1099 Services, you are responsible for, and Stripe disclaims all liability with respect to:

### Stripe Climate

Last modified: November 20, 2023

These Stripe Climate Commitment terms (“**Climate Commitment Terms**”) and Stripe Climate Orders terms (“**Climate Orders Terms**”) (collectively, the “**Terms**”) supplement the General Terms, and govern your use of Stripe Climate Commitment and Stripe Climate Orders. Frontier Climate Operations, LLC (“**Frontier**”), Stripe’s Affiliate, provides Stripe Climate Orders. For purposes of Stripe Climate Orders, each reference to "**Stripe**" in the General Terms will be read as a reference to Frontier.

### 1\. Overview.

Stripe conducts research into Climate Projects and purchases carbon removal services. You may make voluntary contributions to Climate Projects through Stripe Climate Commitment. Frontier uses Offtake Agreements to acquire Carbon Removal Units. You may verify the availability of, and purchase Retirement Services through Stripe Climate Orders.

### 2\. Stripe Climate Commitment Terms.

#### 2.1 Opting In and Out, and Changes.

You must opt in to make a contribution during onboarding or via the Stripe Climate Commitment page of your Stripe Dashboard You may opt out of, change, or pause your contribution to Stripe Climate Commitment at any time in your Stripe Dashboard.

#### 2.2 Climate Commitment Funds.

(a) *Climate Commitment Funds Allocation*. Once you opt in, Stripe or its Affiliate may deduct the Climate Commitment Funds from your Stripe Account balance or User Bank Account on a per-Transaction basis, or as an amount aggregated over a period of time, as described in your Stripe Dashboard. Stripe will allocate all Climate Commitment Funds to advance the field of carbon removal, through activities such as purchasing metric tons of carbon removal, or funding research and development for new carbon removal technologies. Climate Commitment Funds are not refundable.

(b) *Stripe Climate Commitment Goals*. The goal of Stripe Climate Commitment is to help advance the field of carbon removal and Climate Commitment Funds will be used in support of that goal. While Stripe will use reasonable efforts to fund impactful Climate Projects, companies receiving Climate Commitment Funds are developing new technology in an evolving industry and their survival and success in addressing climate issues are not guaranteed. Development timelines of many new technologies are long, the resulting impact may not be immediate, and there is always a risk that the chosen technologies fail to deliver any carbon removal. Even if they are eventually successful in obtaining results, Climate Projects may take years to produce those results.

(c) *Use of Climate Commitment Funds*. You decide voluntarily whether to, and in what amount, to allocate Climate Commitment Funds. Stripe may choose not to use your Climate Commitment Funds immediately after deducting them from your Stripe Account; rather, Stripe may allocate them after Stripe identifies a Climate Project. Stripe will inform you regularly about how Climate Commitment Funds were allocated. Stripe will not apply Climate Commitment Funds toward its own corporate or administrative costs.

(d) *No Carbon Credits*. The carbon removal services Stripe purchases are not certified by any governmental or non-governmental body. They are not “authorized” under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Stripe disclaims all warranties regarding (i) the status under applicable governmental or non-governmental programs or pursuant to standards set by governmental or non-governmental bodies, whether implemented now or in the future, (ii) the availability of any current or future tax credit, benefit, or treatment, or (iii) any other financial benefits, associated with the carbon removal services that Stripe purchases.

(e) *Taxes*. The Climate Commitment Funds you allocate may not be eligible for a tax deduction. You should consult with your tax or legal advisor on the local tax treatment of allocated Climate Commitment Funds. Climate Commitment Funds exclude all Taxes, except as the Documentation states to the contrary.

### 3\. Stripe Climate Orders Terms.

#### 3.1 Your Use of Stripe Climate Orders.

You must only use Stripe Climate Orders in compliance with these Stripe Climate Orders Terms. You must use the Stripe Climate Orders for business purposes only, which must be consistent with the business purpose descriptions you provided to Stripe at the time of onboarding and updated at any time thereafter. You may not use the Stripe Climate Orders for personal, family, or household use.

#### 3.2 CRUs.

(a) Frontier uses Offtake Agreements to acquire CRUs, as further described on the Frontier Webpage. To the extent commercially reasonable, Frontier will review (i) the sources of CRUs; and (ii) the terms governing the generation of those CRUs.

(b) Frontier will make Retirement Services available to you for purchase subject to: (i) the availability of CRUs in carbon markets; (ii) Frontier’s ability to secure all necessary rights (including contractual rights) for the future delivery of the CRUs; and (iii) Frontier’s receipt of those CRUs. You may verify the availability of CRUs for Retirement, and purchase Retirement Services using the Climate API or the Dashboard. While Frontier will provide you with information about the CRUs available for Retirement, it is your responsibility to verify that the CRUs meet your needs or the needs of a Beneficiary.

(c) Frontier may be unable to acquire sufficient quantities of CRUs to fulfill orders for Retirement Services. The CRU(s) that Frontier ultimately Retires on your behalf may have been generated from an Offtake Agreement that Frontier executed after your initial purchase. In order to provide Retirement Services, Frontier reserves the right to: (i) substitute CRUs from any one carbon removal supplier with a CRU from a different carbon removal supplier; or (ii) allocate then-current inventory of CRUs among Purchasers.

(d) The CRUs are not “authorized” under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Frontier disclaims all warranties regarding (i) the status of CRUs under applicable governmental or non-governmental programs or pursuant to standards set by governmental or non-governmental bodies, whether implemented now or in the future, (ii) the availability of any current or future tax credit, benefit, or treatment, or (iii) any other financial benefits, associated with your purchase of Retirement Services or the associated CRU(s).

#### 3.3 Retirement.

(a) On or before the last day of the Retirement Year, Frontier: (i) on your behalf, will Retire the CRU; or (ii) if applicable, will transfer title to the CRU to you. If you have designated a Beneficiary, Frontier will Retire the CRU on that Beneficiary’s behalf and include the Beneficiary’s name in the Registry, if permitted. Frontier will Retire and record the CRU in the applicable Registry in accordance with and subject to the rules of that Registry.

(b) Frontier may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, Retire and record partial CRUs (i.e., partial tons) with a Registry. Frontier may combine partial CRUs and record them in Frontier’s name.

(c) If Frontier Retires a CRU on your behalf or on behalf of a Beneficiary, Frontier will notify you of the Retirement via the Climate API, the Dashboard, or, if applicable, by other means you elect in the Dashboard, and deliver a certificate to you evidencing Retirement. Certificates will be digital.

(d) In the event Frontier does not receive sufficient CRUs to fulfill all orders for Retirement Services, Frontier reserves the right, in its sole discretion: (i) to allocate CRUs among Purchasers; or (ii) refund the Fees.

(e) If Frontier determines that it is unable to Retire a CRU in your name or in the Beneficiary’s name on or prior to the last day of the Retirement Year of the CRU, Frontier will notify you and, in its sole discretion: (i) may refund the applicable Fees; (ii) may transfer title to the CRU to you; (iii) may record the Retirement of the CRU in Frontier’s name and provide certification to you that Frontier completed the Retirement in Frontier’s name; or (iv) take other reasonable remedial measures. Neither Frontier nor Stripe will pay you any interest on Fees, and Frontier will have no further obligation to you regarding that Retirement and the associated CRU(s) nor any other obligation to complete any additional Retirements. Frontier will not be liable to you for any other losses, damages, or costs that you or others may suffer arising out of or relating to Frontier’s inability to perform the Retirement Services or the associated CRU.

(f) If Frontier is unable to contact you, or is unable to provide a refund of Fees, for any reason (e.g., you have closed your Stripe Account), Frontier will contribute any amounts due to you to carbon removal programs of its choosing.

(g) Frontier will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a CRU can be Retired on your behalf or on behalf of your designated Beneficiary. Frontier does not guarantee that Frontier will be able to Retire a CRU on behalf of a Beneficiary.

#### 3.4 Beneficiaries.

You may designate a Beneficiary when you purchase Retirement Services. If permitted by the applicable Registry, Frontier will include the Beneficiary’s name when retiring CRUs. You are responsible for notifying a Beneficiary of a CRU’s Retirement. Frontier will not notify a Beneficiary of a CRU’s Retirement. These Stripe Climate Orders Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties to these Stripe Climate Orders Terms. Frontier has no obligation to any Beneficiary under these Stripe Climate Orders Terms. When you designate a Beneficiary, you will not provide Frontier with a Beneficiary’s Personal Data.

#### 3.5 Power of Attorney.

To the extent necessary, you grant to Frontier a power of attorney to act on your behalf or on behalf of a Beneficiary to provide Stripe Climate Orders.

#### 3.3 Issuing Complaint Handling.

You must submit each Issuing Complaint within 3 business days after you receive the Issuing Complaint to your Platform Provider or, if you do not have one, to issuing-complaints@stripe.com.

You may request specific Card designs for Cards issued to you or to Issuing Authorized Users. You must provide all proposed Card designs to Stripe for review and approval using the process Stripe requires. Stripe will review Card design proposals for compliance with this Agreement, Issuing Bank requirements, the Card Network Rules, Law, and Stripe reputational considerations.

You must resubmit the modified Card design to Stripe for approval using the same process.

Risk of loss for Cards passes to the recipient (you or your Platform Provider) when Stripe ships the Card to the address specified in the order.

If Stripe requests that you or an Issuing Authorized User return a Card, then you must return, or ensure that the Issuing Authorized User returns, that Card promptly to Stripe or the Issuing Bank as Stripe instructs.

#### 4.4 User Materials.

You represent as of the date you submit User Materials for a Card to Stripe for review, and warrant at all times during the Term, that you have the necessary rights in the User Materials to use (and grant Stripe the rights to use) the User Materials on the Cards or for the purposes of the Stripe Issuing Program.

If a Card is lost or stolen, or a Stripe Issuing Accountholder believes that there are fraudulent or unauthorized transactions on a Card, you must immediately cancel the affected Card through the Stripe API or the Stripe Dashboard.

When a Stripe Issuing Accountholder submits or reports an erroneous or unauthorized Card Transaction, Stripe will evaluate the submitted information in accordance with Law.

If Stripe establishes a Reserve, Stripe will notify you of the Reserve terms. Stripe may change the Reserve terms (a) if Stripe believes that there is, or is likely to be, a change in the underlying risk presented by the User Group’s use of Stripe services; or (b) as a Financial Partner or Card Network requires. You have no legal or equitable right or interest in any Reserve, in the funds held in any Reserve, or earnings generated by funds held in any Reserve, and are not entitled to draw funds from any Reserve. If you become subject to an Insolvency Proceeding, funds held in a Reserve will not be part of any estate created in connection with that Insolvency Proceeding. Stripe may fund the Reserve through any or all of:

(i) using funds you provide upon Stripe’s request;

(ii) using funds that a Stripe Entity owes to any User Entity for Card Transactions or other Transactions; or

### 1\. Stripe FA for Platforms Services.

These terms (“**Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms**”) supplement the General Terms and govern your use of the Stripe FA for Platforms Services as a Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder. If you are a Stripe Connect Platform using the Stripe FA for Platforms Services for your own business purposes, these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms apply to you as a Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder, and references to “Stripe Connect Platform” in these terms are also references to you.

### 2\. Use of the Stripe FA for Platforms Services.

#### 2.1 Scope.

Stripe FA for Platforms Services are money transmission services, and SPC is a licensed money transmitter and registered money services business, as defined under the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements. You must reside in the Stripe FA for Platforms Territory to use the Stripe FA for Platforms Services. Your Stripe Connect Platform will provide you access to the Stripe FA for Platforms Services (if applicable). Subject to the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements and these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms, you and your FA for Platforms Authorized Users will be able to (a) add funds to your Financial Account via ACH, wire transfer and other supported funding methods; and (b) transfer funds from your Financial Account to any account able to receive ACH or wire transfers at any financial institution.

#### 2.2 Acknowledgments.

You acknowledge that:  
(a) SPC and its Affiliates are not banks;

(b) the Financial Account is a virtual prepaid account and is not a demand deposit (checking) account, savings account, or other asset or bank account with SPC, an Affiliate of SPC, a FA for Platforms Bank or an Affiliate of a FA for Platforms Bank;

(c) SPC will act as your agent with respect to the Financial Account;

(d) SPC will select the FA for Platforms Bank through which your Financial Account is created;

(e) SPC makes no representation about the sufficiency of the capitalization of the FA for Platforms Bank where your funds are held;

(f) SPC may appoint Stripe as its agent or service provider to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms, other than with respect to money transmission services; and

(g) your use of the Stripe FA for Platforms Services may be subject to additional terms specific to your Stripe Connect Platform, which your Stripe Connect Platform will provide at the time you request access to the Stripe FA for Platforms Services.

### 3\. ACH Access.

(a) Under the Nacha Operating Rules, you are the Originator of the Entries you originate via your Financial Account. You must (a) obtain the consent of each of your payors and payees in compliance with the Nacha Operating Rules before originating an Entry over the ACH Network to debit or credit their account; and (b) maintain the security and integrity of all information you collect in the course of making an Entry. SPC may suspend your access to the ACH Network if you originate an Entry that results in a dispute or unauthorized Financial Account Transaction.

(b) Your rights and obligations concerning any credit Entry transmitted via the ACH Network are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Credit given to the recipient by the recipient’s financial institution for any such credit Entry will be provisional until the recipient’s financial institution has received final settlement through a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise has received payment as provided for in Section 4A-403(a) of Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the State of New York.

Funds in the Custodial Accounts are expected to be eligible for pass-through FDIC Insurance, up to the then-current per depositor limit.

If SPC chooses to comply with an instruction that your Stripe Connect Platform transmits, SPC may impose any condition, including requiring that you provide SPC with a surety bond or put in place an indemnity agreement in a form that is satisfactory to SPC.

You authorize SPC to comply with each Legal Process relating to you or your Financial Account that SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform receives, without needing to determine whether that Legal Process was validly issued or is enforceable. If a Hold is in effect, SPC will continue to charge all applicable fees, even though your Financial Account cannot be closed.

If the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements permit, SPC will deduct those fees and costs from your Available Balance.

#### 8.8 Abandoned Property.

If the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements presume you have abandoned your Financial Account, then SPC will turn over the Available Balance (excluding funds subject to pending debit Financial Account Transactions or Holds) to the appropriate Governmental Authority in the Stripe FA for Platforms Territory according to the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements. You must follow the procedures that the Governmental Authority specifies to obtain your funds.

### 9\. Transactions on Your Financial Account.

#### 9.1 Available Balance.

Solely for the purpose of determining whether funds are available to be transferred or paid out of your Financial Account, the Available Balance is (a) increased by the amount of any pending provisionally credited Financial Account Transactions (excluding pending returns) in your Financial Account; and (b) decreased by the amount of Holds on funds in your Financial Account. You can view your Available Balance on the Stripe FA for Platforms Dashboard.

#### 9.2 Adding Funds to Your Financial Account.

(a) How to Add Funds. You may add funds to your Financial Account by a Financial Account Transaction (such as a direct deposit or an electronic transfer from an external account you own), wire transfer, or from another account at a FA for Platforms Bank.

(b) Agency. You authorize SPC to act as your agent with regard to processing and collecting your Financial Account Transactions. SPC may endorse any credit Financial Account Transaction you present to be added to your Financial Account. If there is a qualified endorsement on a credit Financial Account Transaction, SPC may place your unqualified endorsement on the credit Financial Account Transaction.

(c) No Obligation to Notify. SPC is not obligated to notify you promptly after funds are added into your Financial Account. You can confirm via the Stripe FA for Platforms Dashboard whether SPC has received a Financial Account Transaction that adds funds to your Financial Account.

#### 9.3 Transfers from your Financial Account.

By initiating a transfer from your Financial Account via the Stripe FA for Platforms Dashboard, you authorize your Stripe Connect Platform to instruct SPC to make the Financial Account Transaction you specify. SPC may deduct the amount of each transfer that your Stripe Connect Platform initiates or approves from your Available Balance, even if the transfer has not yet been completed. SPC may refuse any transfer (a) by any method that SPC does not specifically permit for your Financial Account; or (b) that does not include all information SPC or the FA for Platforms Bank requires.

#### 9.4 Funds Availability.

(a) Cut-Off Times. SPC establishes Cut-Off Times for various Financial Account Transactions and SPC will provide those Cut-Off Times to you through the Stripe FA for Platforms Dashboard or otherwise in writing. SPC may change the Cut-Off Time from time to time. Any change to the Cut-Off Time will be effective immediately and without notice to you. You may contact SPC at any time to verify the Cut-Off Time.

(b) Relevance of Cut-Off Times. Subject to Section 9.4(c) of these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms, funds from ACH, wire transfer or a transfer from an account with the FA for Platforms Bank that SPC receives from your Stripe Connect Platform before the Cut-Off Time will be available in your Financial Account on that business day. SPC must receive requests that you make via the Stripe FA for Platforms Dashboard to transfer funds from your Financial Account before the Cut-Off Time in order to initiate the transfer on the same business day. If SPC receives a transfer request on or after the Cut-Off Time or on a day that is not a business day, SPC will generally initiate the transfer on the next business day.

(c) Right to Hold Transfers. SPC may Hold funds transferred to your Financial Account by ACH, wire transfer or a transfer from a Financial Account with the FA for Platforms Bank if SPC has reasonable cause to doubt collectability, is concerned about potential fraud, including for new Financial Accounts or large transfers of funds, or is concerned about compliance with the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements. SPC may place a Hold for more than your Available Balance.

#### 9.5 Account Numbers.

SPC and any other person involved in the Financial Account Transaction may rely on the routing number and account number that you provide when giving a transfer instruction. If the transfer instruction gives both a routing number or account number and a name, and the name identifies a different person from the account owner identified by the number, SPC and any other person that handles the instruction may still rely exclusively on the number.

#### 9.6 Processing Order.

SPC will process your Financial Account Transactions on each business day in the following order:

(a) first, transfers to your Financial Account that SPC receives from your Stripe Connect Platform before the Cut-Off Time will be processed in the order in which SPC receives them, but any amounts credited to your Financial Account are provisionally credited until those funds clear; and

(b) second, transfers from your Financial Account (e.g., other Financial Account Transactions resulting in deducting funds from your Financial Account) that SPC receives by the Cut-Off Time will be processed in the order in which SPC receives them.

Reversals of provisional credits may occur at any time during this process. SPC may use a different processing order if the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements require.

#### 9.7 No Overdrafts.

There is no overdraft feature associated with your Financial Account. If your Available Balance is not sufficient to pay for each Financial Account Transaction in the order in which it is processed, SPC may return or reject the Financial Account Transaction, or SPC may permit the Financial Account Transaction to proceed, in which case your Financial Account may become overdrawn. SPC does not impose a fee when it returns or rejects a Financial Account Transaction for which there are insufficient funds. However, third parties may impose a fee or other charge (such as penalty interest) for dishonored or late payments, and you are solely responsible for those fees and charges.

#### 9.8 Use of Provisional Funds.

All Financial Account Transactions credited to your Financial Account are provisionally credited subject to final settlement. If SPC permits you to transfer funds from your Financial Account before final settlement has been made for any provisionally credited Financial Account Transaction, and final settlement is not made, then you will be liable to SPC for the amount of the drawn provisional credit, collection costs, attorneys’ fees, and all other losses, damages or costs that SPC incurs in allowing the Financial Account Transaction to proceed. SPC has the right to (a) charge your Financial Account; (b) obtain a refund from you; and (c) charge back any provisionally credited Financial Account Transaction. Except to the extent caused by SPC’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, SPC will not be liable for any losses, damages or costs resulting from any reversal of credit or return of any Financial Account Transactions.

#### 9.9 Your Right to Stop Payment.

If you wish to stop any scheduled or preauthorized transfer from your Financial Account, then you must give your Stripe Connect Platform instructions to do so in time for the Stripe Connect Platform to instruct SPC at least 3 business days before the day on which the Financial Account Transaction is scheduled to be made. If you scheduled or preauthorized the transfer via the Stripe FA for Platforms Dashboard, then you may change or cancel the transfer via the Stripe FA for Platforms Dashboard at least 3 business days before the day on which the Financial Account Transaction is scheduled to be made.

#### 9.10 SPC’s Right to Refuse.

To the extent the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements do not prohibit the actions listed in this Section 9.10, SPC may refuse to complete any Financial Account Transaction, including:

(a) if your Financial Account has insufficient funds to cover a Financial Account Transaction;

(b) if SPC is unable to verify ownership of or other information about your Financial Account, or the individual or entity to or from whom the funds will be transferred;

(c) to protect the security of your Financial Account and SPC’s systems; or

(d) if the Financial Account Transaction would violate these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms or the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements.

#### 9.11 Financial Account Transaction Limitations.

There are limits on the number and value of Financial Account Transactions that you may make from your Financial Account, which are described on the Stripe FA for Platforms Dashboard or otherwise disclosed by SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform. SPC may allow Financial Account Transactions that exceed applicable limits, or temporarily reduce your limits from time to time without notice (unless the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements require otherwise). SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform may change the limits at any time.

#### 9.12 Reviewing Your Financial Account Transactions.

(a) Obligation to Review. You must review your Financial Account history and each Financial Account Transaction as soon as possible. If you believe that there is an error or discrepancy in a Financial Account Transaction, you must notify your Stripe Connect Platform promptly, and no later than 30 days after your Stripe Connect Platform makes the Financial Account history available to you (or, if applicable, a longer period stated in the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements). If you believe an unauthorized Financial Account Transaction has been made on your Financial Account, then you must immediately notify your Stripe Connect Platform, and in any case within 1 day after you become aware. If SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform requests, you must submit a written statement with details about the unauthorized Financial Account Transaction. If you fail to notify your Stripe Connect Platform as required under this Section 9.12(a), or your Stripe Connect Platform does not notify SPC in a timely manner, then losses, damages, or costs you suffer as a result of the unauthorized Financial Account Transaction may not be recoverable, or recovery may be more time consuming or difficult.

(b) Assistance in Investigations. You must assist SPC and your Stripe Connect Platform in the investigation and related prosecution of claims for unauthorized Financial Account Transactions by completing the appropriate statements and reports that SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform reasonably requests.

#### 9.13 Withholding Financial Account Transactions.

If after final settlement of any Financial Account Transaction, you or any third party asserts a claim to your Stripe Connect Platform alleging that the Financial Account Transaction was altered, contained a forged or unauthorized signature or endorsement, or was not properly payable for any reason, then SPC may withhold the amount of the Financial Account Transaction from your Financial Account until the claim is finally investigated and resolved.

#### 9.14 Liability Related to Financial Account Transactions.

You are responsible for all Financial Account Transactions on your Financial Account, whether or not they are authorized. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, the Stripe Parties will not be liable to you, your Affiliates or any third party for any losses, damages or costs arising out of or relating to:

(a) a failed Financial Account Transaction on your Financial Account, including if SPC decides to refuse to pay or decline any Financial Account Transaction or if a Financial Account Transaction fails due to circumstances outside of SPC’s control;

(b) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform completing a Financial Account Transaction or otherwise acting in reliance upon any incorrect or incomplete information provided or made available to SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform;

(c) SPC’s refusal to comply with your Stripe Connect Platform’s instructions under Section 7.3 of these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms; or

(d) any correspondent bank’s negligence or failure, or funds lost in transit.

#### 9.15 Compliance with ERISA.

You represent on the date you first use the Stripe FA for Platforms Services, and warrant at all times during the Term, that you do not loan funds to your Financial Account or otherwise deliver property to SPC on behalf of:  
(a) an “employee benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA;

(b) a “plan” within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the IRS Code;

(c) an entity whose underlying assets constitute “plan assets” subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4974 of the IRS Code by reason of Section 3(42) of ERISA, U.S. Department of Labor Regulation 29 C.F.R. Section 25.10.3-101 or otherwise; or

(d) a “governmental plan” (as defined in ERISA or the IRS Code) or another type of plan (or an entity whose assets are considered to include the assets of a governmental plan or other plan) that is subject to any Law or restriction that is substantively similar or of similar effect to Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRS Code.

You must promptly notify your Stripe Connect Platform if you breach this Section 9.15.

### 10\. Fees and Security.

#### 10.1 Fees.

(a) Fee Disclosure. Your Stripe Connect Platform is responsible for disclosing to you all applicable fees (if any) that apply to your use of the Stripe FA for Platforms Services. Your Stripe Connect Platform will disclose those fees at the time you request access to the Stripe FA for Platforms Services and will disclose any changes before they take effect.

(b) Your Responsibility for Disputes. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, you are liable to SPC for all losses, damages and costs that SPC incurs as a result of any dispute involving your Financial Account, including as a result of relying on your Stripe Connect Platform’s representations or instructions. You authorize SPC to (i) deduct these losses, damages and costs from funds in your Financial Account; or (ii) set them off in accordance with Section 10.1(c) of these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms with or without prior notice to you.

(c) Setoff. SPC may deduct, recoup or setoff all fees you owe SPC (if any) from funds in your Financial Account, even if this would cause an overdraft. Alternatively, SPC may invoice you for some or all of those fees on a monthly basis in arrears, and you must pay the fees within 30 days after the date of the invoice.

#### 10.2 Security Interest.

(a) Grant of Security to SPC. To secure debt that you owe to SPC, its Affiliates, or the respective service providers of each (if any, and including amounts owed to SPC that arose from overdrafts or drawn provisional credit under Section 9.7 of these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms), you grant SPC a first-priority security interest in, lien on and right of setoff against, all of your rights in (i) your Financial Account; (ii) the funds SPC holds on your behalf in the Custodial Account (if any); (iii) the interest or income (if any) arising from the Financial Account or the funds in that account, the property acquired with the Financial Account or those funds (if any), and all rights related to the Financial Account and those funds; and (iv) the funds in your Stripe Account (if any). The debts that are secured by this security interest, lien and right of setoff include overdrafts and fees that you may owe in relation to your Financial Account, as well as amounts owed to SPC by another individual or entity if you have guaranteed that you will pay their debts. If a debt like this is due or overdue, SPC may use the funds in your Financial Account to pay all or part of that debt. The Law of the state in which the FA for Platforms Bank is headquartered applies to the funds SPC holds on your behalf in the Custodial Account. SPC may file financing statements under the California Uniform Commercial Code to perfect this security interest in the places, in the form and to the extent it considers necessary or appropriate. SPC will have all the rights of a secured party under the California Uniform Commercial Code with respect to this security interest.

(b) No Other Securities. You must not grant a security interest in, lien on or right of setoff against, any collateral described in Section 10.2(a) of these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms to any other individual or entity.

### 11\. Restricting or Closing Your Financial Account.

#### 11.1 Restricting Your Financial Account.

SPC may decline, delay, freeze or reverse a Financial Account Transaction or part of a Financial Account Transaction, restrict access to your Financial Account or information on your Financial Account, or remove funds from your Financial Account to hold them pending investigation to protect you, SPC or SPC’s Affiliates, or to comply with the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements or other legal obligations. Examples of circumstances where SPC may exercise these rights include where:

(a) you maintain your Financial Account at $0 for at least 90 consecutive days;

(b) your Financial Account has been inactive for at least 12 months;

(c) you breach Section 8.4 of these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms;

(d) your Financial Account is involved in any Legal Process;

(e) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform receives conflicting information or instructions regarding ownership, control or activity of your Financial Account;

(f) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform suspects that you may be the victim of a fraud, scam or financial exploitation; and

(g) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform suspects that a Financial Account Transaction involving you or your Financial Account may involve illegal activity or may be fraudulent.

#### 11.2 Replacement Financial Account.

SPC may transfer your Stripe FA for Platforms Account Account Information and documentation to a replacement Financial Account and account number, including if your Financial Account is reported as compromised, or if SPC reasonably believes it is necessary to protect your Financial Account’s security. SPC may move SPC’s Custodial Accounts (and therefore your Financial Account) to a different financial institution.

#### 11.3 Closing Your Financial Account.

(a) *By SPC*. SPC may close your Financial Account at any time for any reason upon notice to you or your Stripe Connect Platform.

(b) *By You*. You may close your Financial Account at any time by giving 30 days’ notice to your Stripe Connect Platform. During this 30-day period, you may transfer funds from your Financial Account in compliance with these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms.

(c) *SPC Can Keep Financial Account Open*. SPC is not required to close your Financial Account at your Stripe Connect Platform’s request if (i) you have pending Financial Account Transactions; (ii) there is an overdraft on your Financial Account; or (iii) your Financial Account is subject to Legal Process. In those cases, SPC may restrict your Financial Account against all future withdrawals, other than those made under Legal Process, until pending Financial Account Transactions are paid or returned, the account balance is no longer negative, and any legal restriction has been released. If your account balance is greater than $0, after SPC deducts fees, expenses, claims and other deductions that SPC has the right to make, SPC may require you to withdraw the remaining balance before SPC closes your Financial Account.

(d) *Consequences of Closing Financial Account*. After your Financial Account is closed, SPC has no obligation to accept funds into your Financial Account, process Financial Account Transactions through the Financial Account on your behalf, or satisfy any outstanding demands for payment. But, SPC may reopen your Financial Account if SPC receives funds payable to your Financial Account.

(e) *Access to Account History*. After your Financial Account is closed, SPC will enable your Stripe Connect Platform to provide you access to your Financial Account history for 60 days.

#### 11.4 Adverse Claims.

If there are conflicting instructions with respect to your Financial Account or if there is any dispute regarding your Financial Account, then without limiting SPC’s rights under these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms, SPC may refer the conflict or dispute to a court for resolution. If any person notifies SPC of a dispute, SPC does not need to decide if the dispute has merit before SPC takes further action. SPC may exercise any of these rights without notice to you.

### 12\. Limitation of Liability.

To the extent that the FA for Platforms Regulatory Requirements invalidate or render unenforceable any limitations or exclusions of liability of SPC and its Affiliates under this Agreement with respect to failing to stop payment on a Financial Account Transaction, or paying a Financial Account Transaction bearing an unauthorized or forged signature or endorsement, then the Stripe Parties’ aggregate liability with respect to those circumstances will be limited to the face value of the Financial Account Transaction.

### 13\. Interpretation.

In these Stripe FA for Platforms Accountholder Terms, references to “business days” are to business days in the City of New York on which the FA for Platforms Bank is open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its banking functions.
