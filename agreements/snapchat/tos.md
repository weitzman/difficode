Snap Inc. Terms of Service

Effective: April 7, 2025

Welcome!

We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you as a user of Snapchat, Bitmoji, or any of our other products or services that are subject to them, such as My AI, (which we refer to collectively as the “Services”). Our Services are personalized and we provide information about how they work in these Terms, our [Privacy, Safety, and Policy Hub](http://values.snap.com/?lang=en-US), on our [Support Site](https://help.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US), and within the Services (such as notices, consents, and settings). The information we provide forms the main subject matter of these Terms.

Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where they may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: these Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Inc. (“Snap”). So please read them carefully.

By using any of our Services, you agree to the Terms. If so, Snap grants you a non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to use the Services in accordance with these Terms and our policies. Of course, if you don’t agree with the Terms, then don’t use the Services.

These Terms apply if you live in the United States or if your principal place of business is in the United States. If you live outside of the United States or if your principal place of business is outside of the United States, Snap Group Limited provides you the Services and your relationship is governed by the [Snap Group Limited Terms of Service](/terms?lang=en-US#sgl-terms).

Where we have provided summary sections in these Terms, these summaries have been included for your convenience only and you should read these Terms in full to understand your legal rights and obligations.

**ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN** [**ARBITRATION CLAUSE**](/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration) **A LITTLE LATER ON. YOU AND SNAP AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AS EXPLAINED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE.**

1\. Who Can Use the Services

Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and you must confirm that you are 13 years or older to create an account and use the Services. If we have actual knowledge that you are under the age of 13 (or the minimum age at which a person may use the Services in your state, province, or country without parental consent, if greater), we will cease providing the Services to you and delete your account and your data. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all such terms carefully. By using the Services, you represent, warrant, and agree that:

*   you can form a binding contract with Snap;
    
*   you are not a person who is barred from using the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction — including, for example, that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition;
    
*   you are not a convicted sex offender; and
    
*   you will comply with these Terms (including any other terms and policies referenced in these Terms, such as the [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Music on Snapchat Guidelines](/music-guidelines?lang=en-US), and the [Commercial Content Policy](/terms/commercial-content?lang=en-US)) and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.
    

If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you represent that you are authorized to bind that business or entity to these Terms and you agree to these Terms on behalf of that business or entity (and all references to “you” and “your” in these Terms will mean both you as the end user and that business or entity). If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity of the U.S. Government, you agree to the [Amendment to Snap Inc. Terms of Service for U.S. Government Users](/terms/us-amendment?lang=en-US).

*In summary: Our Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 13 or the minimum age at which a person may use the Services in your state, province, or country if it is older than 13. If we become aware that you are under this age we will suspend your use of the Services and delete your account and data. Other terms may apply to our Services which require you to be even older to use them so please review these carefully when prompted.*

2\. Rights You Grant Us

Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the settings you have selected.

For all content you create using the Services, or submit or make available to the Services (including Public Content), you grant Snap and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, analyze, transmit, and distribute that content, including the name, image, likeness, or voice of anyone featured in it. This license is for the purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones. This license includes a right for us to make your content available to, and pass these rights along to, service providers with whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing and improving such Services.

We call Public Story submissions and any other content you submit to public Services, like Public Profiles, Spotlight, Snap Map, or Lens Studio, “Public Content.” Because Public Content is inherently public, you grant Snap, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual right and license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronize, overlay graphics and auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of your Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed, for commercial and non-commercial purposes. This license applies to the separate video, image, sound recording, or musical compositions contained in your Public Content, as well as the name, image, likeness, and voice of anyone featured in Public Content that you create, upload, post, send, or appear in (including as reflected in your Bitmoji). This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation if your content, including videos, photos, sound recordings, musical compositions, name, image, likeness, or voice included in your content are used by us, our affiliates, users of the Services, or our business partners. For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US) and [Support Site](https://help.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US). All Public Content must be appropriate for people ages 13+.

While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms or any applicable laws. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Services.

We, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services, including personalized advertising based on the information you provide us, we collect, or we obtain about you. Advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your content.

We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you. You agree that we will own all rights in anything we develop based on such feedback or suggestions.

*In summary: If you post content that you own to the Services, you remain the owner but you allow us and others to use it to provide and promote our Services. You also allow other users to view and, in some cases, use any content you make available to others on the Services. We have various rights to change and remove your content, but you always remain responsible for everything you create, post or share**, or direct us to use on the Services**.*

3\. Additional Terms and Policies That May Apply

Additional terms and conditions listed on the [Terms & Policies](/policies?lang=en-US) page or that are otherwise made available to you will apply to you depending on the specific Services you use. If those additional terms apply (for example, because you use the applicable Services), then they will become part of these Terms, meaning that you must comply with them. For example, if you purchase or use any paid features that we make available to you on Snapchat (such as a Snapchat+ subscription, but excluding advertising services) you agree that our [Paid Features Terms](/terms/paid-features?lang=en-US) apply. If any of the applicable additional terms conflict with these Terms, the additional terms will override and apply in place of the conflicting parts of these Terms.

*In summary: Additional terms may apply, please take the time to read them carefully.*

4\. Privacy

Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how your information is handled when you use our Services by reading our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US). You can also learn more about our privacy practices, including how certain features use your data, on our [Privacy, Safety, and Policy Hub](https://values.snap.com/?lang=en-US).

5\. Personalized Recommendations

Our Services provide a personalized experience to make them more relevant and engaging for you. We will recommend content, advertising, and other information to you based on what we know and infer about your and others’ interests from use of our Services. It is necessary for us to handle your personal information for this purpose, as we explain in our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US). Personalization is also a condition of our contract with you for us to be able to do so, unless you opt to receive less personalization in the Services. You can find more information on personalized recommendations on our [Support Site](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/17338132910484?utm_source=web&utm_medium=tos&utm_campaign=personalization_opt_out&lang=en-US).

*In summary: Our Services provide a personalized experience, including advertising and other recommendations to you based on data we collect as explained* [*here*](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/17338132910484?utm_source=web&utm_medium=tos&utm_campaign=personalization_opt_out&lang=en-US) *and in our* [*Privacy Policy*](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US)*.*

6\. AI Features

Our Services include AI-enabled features (“AI Features”) that use inputs like text, images, audio files, videos, documents, data, or other content provided by you or used at your direction (“Inputs”) to generate content and responses based on those Inputs (“Outputs”). All Inputs and Outputs will be treated for the purpose of these Terms as content you submit to the Services and accordingly any rights and licenses granted to us and obligations on you in respect of content submitted or made available by you in these Terms applies to Inputs and Outputs, including the licenses set out in “Rights You Grant Us” above. We collect, use, disclose, and retain Inputs and Outputs in accordance with our Privacy Policy. 

While we integrate certain safeguards into AI Features, Outputs may not be reviewed in advance and may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, offensive, objectionable, inappropriate, infringing, unsuitable, unlawful, unfit for particular purposes, or the same or similar to content generated for other users of the Services. Outputs may also contain content inconsistent with Snap’s view, and Snap does not endorse any content included in any Outputs. If Outputs reference individuals or third parties including their products or services, it does not mean the individual or third party endorses Snap, or that they or these products are affiliated with Snap. 

AI Features and Outputs are provided as-is and made available to you without representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. This means that your use of any AI Features and Outputs is at your own risk, and you should not rely on them for any purpose, including to make decisions or for professional, medical, legal, financial, educational or other advice. Outputs are not Snap representations.

When using our AI Features, unless we give our permission, you must not, and must not take any action that would reasonably be expected to: 

*   use Inputs that contain or make use of, and otherwise could reasonably be expected to generate Outputs that contain or make use of, content that you do not have permission to use, would violate the rights of others, or has otherwise been unlawfully obtained; 
    
*   violate any submission guidelines or other policies we make available to you that apply to your use of AI Features or submission of Inputs; 
    
*   direct AI Features to generate any Outputs in violation of these Terms, the Community Guidelines, or any applicable intellectual property right, contractual restriction, or applicable laws, or which might otherwise cause harm; 
    
*   alter, obscure, or remove any watermark or disclosure applied to Outputs by the AI Features; 
    
*   circumvent any safety or privacy features, safeguards, or mechanisms in the AI Features; 
    
*   use or share Outputs that will be used to train, develop, or fine tune models, services, or other AI technologies; or
    
*   misrepresent Outputs as having been human-generated or otherwise generated without the use of artificial intelligence.
    

Separate terms apply to any AI Features you use through or in connection with our business Services and Lens Studio instead of those set out above, and will be displayed to you in connection with your use of those other Services. 

*In summary: Inputs and Outputs from AI Features may be used in accordance with our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and terms relevant to the AI-specific products you use. AI Features may not be accurate or appropriate and you should not rely on them as a source of truth, facts, or substitute for human judgment.*

  

7\. Content Moderation

Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the user or entity that submitted it. Although Snap reserves the right to review, moderate, or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not review all of it. So we cannot — and do not — guarantee that other users or the content they provide through the Services will comply with our Terms, [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or our other terms, policies or guidelines. You can read more about Snap’s approach to content moderation on our [Support Site](http://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation?lang=en-US).

Users can report content produced by others or others’ accounts for violation of our Terms, [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or other guidelines and policies. More information about how to report content and accounts is available on our [Support Site](https://values.snap.com/safety/safety-reporting?lang=en-US).

We hope you’ll understand any decisions we make about content or user accounts, but if you have any complaints or concerns, you can use the submission form available [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/18120518120340?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web_snap&utm_campaign=tos&lang=en-US) or use available in-app options. If you use this process, your complaint must be submitted within six months of the relevant decision.

Upon receiving a complaint, we will:

*   ensure the complaint is reviewed in a timely, non-discriminatory, diligent and non-arbitrary manner;
    
*   reverse our decision if we determine our initial assessment was incorrect; and
    
*   inform you of our decision and of any possibilities for redress promptly.
    

*In summary: Most content on the Services is owned or controlled by others and we don't have any control or responsibility over that content. We have content moderation policies and processes in place that apply to content on the Services.*

8\. Respecting the Services and Snap’s Rights

As between you and us, Snap is the owner of the Services, which includes all related brands, works of authorship, Bitmoji avatars that you assemble, software, and other proprietary content, features, and technology. The Services may also be covered by patents owned by Snap or its affiliates, including those listed at [www.snap.com/patents](/patents?lang=en-US).

You must also respect Snap’s rights and adhere to the [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Bitmoji Brand Guidelines](https://www.bitmoji.com/bitmoji_brand_guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US), and any other guidelines, support pages, or FAQs published by Snap or our affiliates. That means, among other things, you may not do, attempt to do, enable, or encourage anyone else to do, any of the following and doing so may result in us terminating or suspending your access to the Services:

*   use branding, logos, icons, user interface elements, product or brand look and feel, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials Snap makes available via the Services, except as explicitly allowed by these Terms, the [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Bitmoji Brand Guidelines](https://www.bitmoji.com/bitmoji_brand_guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US), or other brand guidelines published by Snap or our affiliates;
    
*   violate or infringe Snap’s, our affiliates’, or any other third party’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights, including by using the Services to submit, display, post, create, or generate any infringing content;
    
*   copy, modify, archive, download, upload, disclose, distribute, sell, lease, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, make derivatives of, or otherwise use the Services or the content on the Services, other than temporary files that are automatically cached by your web browser for display purposes, as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing, or as enabled by the Service’s intended functionality;
    
*   attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications, solicit login credentials from other users, or buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your account, a username, Snaps, or a friend link;
    
*   reverse engineer, make unauthorized copies or derivative works of, decompile, disassemble, modify or decode the Services (including any underlying idea, technology, or algorithm) or any content included therein, or otherwise extract the source code of the software of the Services, without our written permission, except to the extent an exception or limitation applies under an open source license or applicable laws;
    
*   use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, script, software, or other automated or semi-automated means, processes or interfaces to access, scrape, extract or copy the Services, including any user data, content or other data contained in the Services;
    
*   use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content or information without our written consent;
    
*   use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services;
    
*   upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise, bypass, or circumvent the security of the Services;
    
*   attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access;
    
*   use the Services to create or develop a competing product or service;
    
*   state or imply that we endorse your content;
    
*   probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network;
    
*   violate any applicable law or regulation in connection with your access to or use of the Services; or
    
*   access or use the Services in any way not expressly permitted by these Terms or our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US).
    

*In summary: We own or control all of the content, features and functionalities of the Services, except your content. To ensure the Services and other users are protected from harm, there are rules we need you to follow when you use our Services. Failure to comply with these rules may result in suspension or termination of your account.*

9\. Respecting Others' Rights

Snap respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights. When you submit content to the Services, you agree and represent that you own that content, or that you have received all necessary permissions, clearances, licenses, and authorizations in order to submit it to the Services (including, if applicable, the right to make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in any sound recordings, synchronize any compositions to any content, publicly perform any compositions or sound recordings, or any other applicable rights for any music not provided by Snap that you include in your content) and grant the rights and licenses contained in these Terms for your content. You also agree that you will not use or attempt to use another user’s account except as permitted by Snap or its affiliates.

Snap honors trademark, copyright, and other intellectual property laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and takes reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. If Snap becomes aware that a user has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to suspend or terminate the user’s account. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please report it using the form accessible through this [tool](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012332110996?lang=en-US). Or you may file a notice with our designated agent: Snap Inc., Attn: Copyright Agent, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, email: copyright @ snap.com. Don’t use this email address for anything other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be ignored. To report other forms of infringement, including trademark infringement, on the Services, please use the tool accessible [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012332110996?lang=en-US). 

If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must comply with the requirements set forth at [17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512?lang=en-US). That means the notice must:

*   contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
    
*   identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
    
*   identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material;
    
*   provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;
    
*   provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
    
*   provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
    

*In summary: Make sure you own or have the right to use any content you make available on the Services. If you use content owned by someone else without permission, we may terminate your account. If you see anything which you believe infringes your intellectual property rights, let us know.*

10\. Safety

We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that you will at all times comply with these Terms, including our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) and any other policies Snap makes available in order to maintain the safety of the Services.

If you fail to comply, we reserve the right to remove any offending content; terminate or limit the visibility of your account, and retain data relating to your account in accordance with our data retention policies; and notify third parties — including law enforcement — and provide those third parties with data and any other information relating to your account. This step may be necessary to protect the safety of our users and others; to investigate, remedy, and enforce potential Terms violations; and to detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.

We also care about your physical safety and wellbeing while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never use the Services while driving. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way just to capture a Snap or to engage with other Snapchat features.

*In summary: We try to make our Services as safe as possible, but we need your help. These Terms, our Community Guidelines, and other Snap policies contain important information about how to keep the Services and other users safe. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way when using our Services.*

11\. Your Account

To use certain Services, you need to create an account. You agree to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated information for your account. You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure. One way to help keep your account secure is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account and to enable two-factor authentication. If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to [Support](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012305621908?lang=en-US). Any software that we provide to you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings. You agree not to create any account if we have previously removed or banned you or your account from any of our Services, unless we consent otherwise.

*In summary: Keep your account details safe and secure. Only use an account if you are authorized by us to do so.*

12\. Memories

Memories is our personalized data-storage service. Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account. Since we can’t promise that your content will always be available, we recommend keeping a separate copy of content you save to Memories. We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the right to set storage limits for Memories, or to prohibit certain types of content from being eligible for use with Memories, and we may change these limits and prohibitions from time to time in our sole discretion.

*In summary: Memories is a personalized storage service, it will be automatically enabled, but you can control some features. We cannot guarantee that any Memories will be stored forever either, so please do keep a backup.*

13\. Data Charges and Mobile Phones

You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services. This includes data charges and charges for messaging, such as SMS, MMS, or other messaging protocols or technologies (collectively, “Messages”). If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.

By providing us with your mobile phone number you agree, among other things, to receive Messages from Snap related to the Services, including about promotions (where we have consent or as permitted by law), your account, and your relationship with Snap. You agree that these Messages may be received even if your mobile phone number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list, or international equivalent.

If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create an account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending messages intended for you to someone else.

*In summary: We may send you Messages, and mobile charges may apply when you use our Services.*

14\. Third-Party Materials and Services

Certain Services may display, include, or make available content, data, information, applications, features, or materials from third parties (“Third-Party Materials”), provide links to certain third-party websites, or permit the use of Third-Party Materials or third-party services in connection with those Services. If you use any Third-Party Materials or third-party services made available through or in connection with our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), the applicable third-party’s terms will govern their relationship with you. Neither Snap nor any of our affiliates is responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken under any third party’s terms. Further, by using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Snap is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, availability, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality, or any other aspect of such Third-Party Materials or third-party services or websites. We do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party services, Third-Party Materials, or third-party websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third-Party Materials, the availability of third-party services and links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience to you.

*In summary: Snap isn't responsible for third-party features, content or services accessible via or in connection with our Services – please make sure you read the third party's terms.*
