**Last Updated: October 13, 2025**

This Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”) of Mint Mobile, LLC (collectively, “Mint Mobile,” “we,” “us” or “our”) describes the information we collect through our websites  or otherwise from Mint Mobile customers, and is incorporated into and made a part of the Mint Mobile [Plan Terms and Conditions](https://www.mintmobile.com/plan-terms-and-conditions/), the [Site Terms of Use](https://www.mintmobile.com/site-terms-of-use/), and [Mobile Application End User License Agreement](https://www.mintmobile.com/app-end-user-license-agreement/).

1.  **Purpose of Privacy Notice**  
    Your privacy is important to Mint Mobile. Accordingly, Mint Mobile provides these notices or policies so that you understand how Mint Mobile collects, uses and, in certain circumstances, discloses the information that you provide and/or that is automatically provided to Mint Mobile as a result of your visiting and using our websites or purchasing or using Mint Mobile products or services. This Privacy Notice also explains the steps Mint Mobile has taken to secure your personal information. Finally, this Privacy Notice explains your options regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. By visiting this Site or purchasing or using any Mint Mobile product or service, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Notice. Mint Mobile is not responsible for the content or privacy practices on any third-party website that may be linked to or from this Site. Any questions regarding this Privacy Notice should be directed to our customer service department at (800) 683-7392.
2.  **Collection and Use of Personal Information**  
    Mint Mobile collects personal data about its customers. The ways in which we collect personal data about you include, but are not limited to, the following:  
    *   ***Registration and Ordering.*** Before using certain parts of our websites or purchasing Mint Mobile products or services, you must complete an online registration form or provide certain information to Mint Mobile’s representatives. During registration (whether via our websites or otherwise), you will be prompted to provide to Mint Mobile certain personal information, which may include, but is not limited to, your name, billing address(es), phone number, port-in phone number, email address, and debit/credit card number. This personal information is used for billing purposes, fulfilling your orders, and communicating with you about your order and our websites, and for marketing purposes. If Mint Mobile encounters a problem when processing your order, it will use your personal information to contact you.
    *   ***User Submissions.*** Certain areas of our websites may permit you to enter your email address and other contact information to receive further information about Mint Mobile or for other purposes. Your submissions for these purposes are completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to us. Should you choose to submit personal data in response to these requests, we may collect and process that data to market Mint Mobile products and services or any other products and services that we offer.
    *   ***Automatically Generated and Collected Information.*** In addition to personal data that you voluntarily provide as described above, our websites utilize technologies to collect information and track your user experience. We use this information to improve our websites and user experience. In addition, our websites automatically recognize the Internet URL from which you access our websites and may also log your Internet protocol (“IP”) address (which may indicate the approximate location of your device on the Internet), Internet service provider, and date/time stamp for system administration, order verification, marketing, and system troubleshooting purposes. In addition, all wireless communication systems know when your phone is turned on and approximately where the device is physically located.
    *   ***Information Collected by and/or Provided to Third Parties.*** We may obtain information about you and combine it with your account information for our business purposes as explained below in Section 9. For example, we may receive personal data from the retailer from whom you purchased a Mint Mobile product prior to your commencing service with us. In addition, we use third-party service providers to serve ads and/or collect personal data on our behalf. Some of these third party service providers may collect information about your visits to our websites, such as your interactions with our products and services to tailor marketing messages or to trigger real time interaction, customize our websites, or enhance your experience. Some of these service providers may be able to collect personal data that you share with this site via a web form automatically and prior to your pressing a submit button; and they may be able to use information from your visits to our websites to send marketing messages to you in a way that may personally identify you. This information is collected via industry standard technology used by most major web sites. Such information may include your device’s IP address, user agent, email addresses (where hashed or otherwise rendered pseudonymous) and other user and device level pseudonymous information. Please keep in mind that your browser settings may not permit you to control the technologies utilized by these third-party companies. If you would like more information about these practices, please click: [https://optout.aboutads.info/.](https://optout.aboutads.info/)
    *   ***Location-Based Services.*** We use location information to route wireless communications and to provide 911 service, which allows emergency services to locate your general location. We may disclose, without your consent, the approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical harm. Depending on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array of services based on the location of your device (for example, driving directions, enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.). These data services, known as Location-Based Services (“LBS”) are made available by us and other entities, usually via applications. These services use various location technologies and acquire location data from various sources. These applications and services use various location technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite (“GPS”), Assisted GPS (“AGPS”), cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate location of a device, which is then used in conjunction with the application to enhance the user’s experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.). LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on our supplier’s network, and location-based services may or may not look to our network to obtain location data. Where our network supplier allows third parties the capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from our supplier’s network, our network supplier requires those third parties to observe specific privacy and security protections consistent with this notice. It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the terms under which these services are provided – whether by us or another entity. You should carefully review the privacy policies or notices and other terms of third parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing your location information to other people. Where we provide a location-based service, you will receive notice of the location features of the service and collection of location data is with your consent. You will be provided options for managing when and how such information should be shared.

Generally, we collect the above information for the following purposes: (i) to improve your experience on our websites; (ii) to improve the products and services that Mint Mobile sells to consumers;(iii) to communicate with you regarding our websites; (iv) to market and sell products and services to you and send you information about special offers; (v) to contact you about products or services you have purchased from Mint Mobile (including but not limited to the Mint Mobile service); (vi) to respond to your inquiries; (vii) to manage and develop our business and operations, administer accounts, and collect and process payments; and (viii) if you authorize text messaging, we will use your mobile number to communicate with you about your account and to send marketing text messages to you. If you decide that you no longer wish to receive emails or text messages from us that you had authorized, you may opt-out of receiving emails and text messages by managing your Mint Mobile account preferences or by any other reasonable opt-out method available to you. Please note that we may have to communicate with you about product or service orders that you choose to place. You cannot opt-out of receiving product or service-related emails. We will not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your specific personal information or financial information to third parties, except as noted below. Mint Mobile may sell, rent, trade, license, use and disclose all non-personal information and aggregate information, so long as such information does not personally identify you or any user, to any third party for any purpose, including, but not limited to, research and analytical purposes. Under federal law, you have a right, and Mint Mobile has a duty, to protect the confidentiality of information regarding your telephone use, the services you purchase from us, the calls you place and the location of your device on our network when you make a telephone call. This information is referred to as, among other things, “Customer Proprietary Network Information.”  We may share Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) with our affiliates.  Under federal law, you have the choice to approve or disapprove certain uses of your CPNI that are outside the scope of ordinary business operations, fraud prevention, or legal compliance. Mint Mobile does not use or share CPNI in ways that would trigger this approval process—like sharing your CPNI with others to help them market their stuff. You also have the option to access and manage your CPNI in Section 9, below.

Mint Mobile may disclose your personal data to third parties, including in the following circumstances:

*   Mint Mobile uses third party service providers to perform specific functions on its behalf, and it must disclose personal data to help those parties perform their services (for example, Mint Mobile would disclose your name, address and phone number to a commercial carrier such as Federal Express or UPS in order to deliver a physical product that you order, and it would disclose your name and debit/credit card number and other information to financial services and debit/credit card processing companies in order to process your orders).
*   Mint Mobile may be required to disclose personal data in response to a legal process, order or investigation (for example, a subpoena or court order).
*   Mint Mobile may disclose personal data where disclosure is necessary to protect its legal rights or to protect itself or others (for example, in order to reduce the risk of fraud or illegal activities).
*   Mint Mobile may share personal data among its affiliated companies (for example, for the purpose of marketing products and services to you).
*   Mint Mobile may provide identity verification services to third parties, and your personal data may be included in the data transferred to third parties in connection with those services.
*   Mint Mobile may acquire, merge with or be acquired by another company, or it might sell some or all of its assets, and, in such a case, your personal data may be included in the transferred business assets. Also, in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, your personal data may be included in the transferred assets.

**3\. Cookies and Similar Online Tracking Technologies**  
A cookie is a small data file that allows websites to recognize your browser or store information and/or settings. A website will send a small data file—or cookie—to your browser to first recognize it. Then it will store that information on your device. Mint Mobile may use “persistent” and “session” cookies. Persistent cookies are stored on your device and used for various purposes by your browser on returning website visits—like to avoid having to re-enter your login information and saving your language preference. Session cookies are more temporary. They are stored in the browser for the duration of the browser session and are erased after you end a browser session or shut off your device. Session replay tools record how users interact with websites and apps. By capturing mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and more, companies can discover and correct problems users are experiencing.  
**Your choices**  
You can change your cookie preferences in your browser settings. If you block cookies, some things on our website—and other websites—may not work properly.  In certain states, our websites display a pop-up banner to users. This banner lets users say no to session replay technology from a third-party that helps us analyze and improve user experience, reduce customer frustration, and prevent fraud.

Once you’ve confirmed your choice, the setting will be saved for one year. You can return to this notice to change your setting at any time.

Set your preference  

**Web beacons**  
A web beacon is an invisible digital object embedded in a webpage or email. Sometimes they can be called transparent or single pixel “GIFs.” Web beacons are used to monitor your interactions with that webpage or email—counting visitors, determining whether emails are opened, or monitoring how long a webpage was viewed.

**Your choices**  
Our webpages and emails may contain web beacons from our partners too, which help us compile statistics about the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns or assess website operations.

To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a “sale” or “sharing” (which includes targeted advertising) of personal information under California law, you can tell us not to sell or share your personal information as explained below in Section 9.

**4\. Security**  
We take precautions and have implemented certain technical measures intended to protect against unauthorized access to, disclosure of, and unlawful interception of personal information submitted via our websites, including Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) for all financial transactions through our websites. However, your communications containing personal information may be unlawfully intercepted or accessed by third parties and/or our websites may be subject to network attacks or malfunctions. We cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information transmitted over the Internet. Once we receive your personal information, we take steps that we believe are reasonable to limit access to your personal information to only those employees and service providers whom we determine need access to the personal information to provide the requested products, services, offers or opportunities that may be of interest to you or that you have ordered, or that we otherwise disclose in accordance with Section 2 above. However, even after we receive your personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee that your personal information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed as a result of a breach of our security efforts or as a result of any other event beyond our reasonable control. Accordingly, we cannot and do not guarantee that your personal information or any other information is completely secure and safe from any risk.

**5\. Protection of Children & Children’s Privacy Notice**  
Mint Mobile does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18 (or the age of majority in their state of residence, whichever age is greater) (“Child,” “Children,” or “Child(ren)”) without the express authorization of their parent or legal guardian, which authorization may be revoked at any time, resulting in termination of wireless service. Moreover, Mint Mobile does not knowingly solicit Children to purchase any of its products or services, including without limitation mobile wireless service plans.  
For additional information related to our data practices for users under the age of **18** (or the age of majority in their state of residence), please see our **Children’s Privacy Notice:** [https://www.mintmobile.com/childrens-privacy-policy/.](https://www.mintmobile.com/childrens-privacy-policy/)

**6\. Advertisements and Links**  
This Site may display advertisements and links for third-party websites, products and services. Information you provide directly to third parties and information collected from you by third parties in connection with your use of their websites, products or services will be subject to such third parties’ privacy policies or notices and not this Privacy Notice.

**7\. Your Account Preferences  
**Upon your request, Mint Mobile will: (a) correct or update your personal information; (b) stop sending emails to your email address; (c) stop sending text messages to your mobile phone number; (d) stop sending mail (including promotional materials) to your mailing address; and/or (d) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. You may make these updates/ changes yourself by logging into your account on this website or by any other reasonable account update mechanism available to you. You also have the ability, at any time, to click through an “Unsubscribe” link, contained in all marketing e-mails, in order to stop receiving such e-mails. You also may text STOP to +1 (833) 796-0308 (or in response to any marketing text message from Mint Mobile), at any time, to unsubscribe from marketing text messages. You may also send your requests to: Attn: Customer Service, Mint Mobile, LLC, 17870 Newhope Street #104-155, Fountain Valley, CA 92708; or by phone at (800) 683-7392. Please do not email your debit or credit card number or other sensitive information. Please note that Mint Mobile may have to communicate with you about product or service orders that you choose to place. Accordingly, you cannot opt-out of receiving product or service-related emails or mailings. ***Do Not Track (DNT) Disclosure:*** This Site does not currently respond to “Do Not Track” signals of web browsers in general, as there currently are no uniform technological standards for recognizing and implementing “Do Not Track” signals. However, this website does respond to signals sent from a service called the **Global Privacy Control (GPC),** which may be considered a “Do Not Track” signal. For more information, see Section 9 below.

**8\. Contact Us**

For privacy related questions, comments and requests, please contact Mint Mobile at:  
Mint Mobile, LLC

Phone: (800) 683-7392

**9\. California **Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)****  
California has a data protection law called the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It gives California consumers the right to tell companies to not sell or share their personal information. We extend this same privacy choice to all our customers regardless of their state of residence. 

****Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information****

We use the terms “sell” and “share” as they are defined in the CCPA. The CCPA defines “sell” or “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal information (including information that does not directly identify an individual) in exchange for anything of value, which isn’t limited to the exchange of money. “Share” is defined narrowly as providing personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising to a consumer based on information about their activity on multiple websites across the internet. We engage in certain activities (as described below) that may be considered selling or sharing personal information under the CCPA. That’s why we include a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link at the bottom of most of our website pages and in some of our apps. When you click it, you get to make a choice about your online privacy with us. A pop-up window will appear where you can change your “Do Not Sell or Share” setting. If the pop-up window doesn’t appear, check your browser’s pop-up settings. Note that according to the CCPA, certain exchanges of personal information aren’t considered selling or sharing. For example, if you specifically direct us to share your personal information, then we’ll do so. It is also not selling or sharing if we place ads based solely on information we collect when you visit our websites. Other examples include disclosures of personal information to service providers or other third parties as described in Section 2 above. 

Bottom line: If you tell us not to sell or share your personal information, we won’t. However, we’ll still need to share some personal information with our service providers so you can, for example, receive products and services from us.  

**Global Privacy Control** 

Mint Mobile participates in a service called the **Global Privacy Control (GPC)** that lets you set a “Do Not Sell or Share” preference at the browser level. You’ll need to have a GPC-enabled browser or browser extension that you’ll activate or turn on in the browser. When you visit a website, your browser will automatically send the site a “Do Not Sell or Share” signal and participating websites, like ours, will honor your preference. Note: Not all browsers and extensions offer a GPC setting. To download a GPC-enabled browser, go to the Global Privacy Control website. To check if our website received your GPC signal, click on the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in our footer. If we’re receiving your GPC signal, we’ll automatically opt you out of the sale of your personal information and tell you that a GPC signal was used. When we’re detecting your active GPC signal, we won’t allow you to opt back into the sale or sharing of your personal information.

**Personal Information We Collect, Disclose for a Business Purpose, and Sell or Share**

The chart below summarizes the categories of personal information we may have collected from you in the past 12 months, and how we collect, use, disclose, sell, or share your personal information. Mint Mobile does not knowingly collect, use, disclose, sell, or share personal information from anyone under 18 years old without the express authorization of their parent or legal guardian (see above **Children’s Privacy Notice).** We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the business purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When determining the length of time to retain your information, we consider various criteria, including whether we need the information to comply with our legal obligations; resolve disputes; enforce our agreements; protect against fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal activity; or for other related business purposes.

**Sensitive Personal Information**

In California and certain other states, consumers may choose to limit the use of “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) to certain purposes specified in the CCPA.
