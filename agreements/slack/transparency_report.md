At Slack we care deeply about maintaining the trust of our customers, as well as being as transparent as possible about government and third party requests for Customer data. As a part of this commitment, we publish periodic reports about requests for data by law enforcement and governmental entities. The latest report is below and covers all such requests from January 1 - December 31, 2021. More information about our policies and practices with respect to data (including definitions of terms not defined herein) can be found in the [Slack Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service), [Privacy Policy](https://slack.com/privacy-policy), [Security Practices](https://slack.com/security-practices), [Data Request Policy](https://slack.com/user-data-request-policy) and [Data Request Overview](https://slack.com//trust/data-requests).

## We abide by the following Guiding Principles:

*   We are committed to maintaining Customer privacy and confidentiality.
*   All legal process is carefully reviewed. Slack rejects or challenges any requests that have no legal basis or are unclear, overbroad, or otherwise inappropriate.
*   Unless prohibited by law, Slack notifies a customer when it receives a request for that customer’s data, including a government request.
*   Slack construes legal process as narrowly as possible.
*   Wherever possible we encourage Customers and third parties to obtain relevant data without our intervention. We strongly believe that any government agency seeking access to customer data should address its request directly with that customer, where possible.
