WHAT INFORMATION

WE HAVE AND

WHERE WE GET IT

When providing our products and services, we collect certain categories of personal information such as your contact details, purchase history, internet and electronic activity, and in some cases sensitive personal information where required or where you have provided consent.

When we collect your personal information, we store it in our customer databases, such as our ticketing platforms to manage your event access, our payment platforms to process your orders, our customer services platforms to manage any queries you have, and our marketing systems in order to be able to communicate with you, subject to your choices.

Given the global nature of our business, some of the products and services we offer may differ and not be available in the country where you have an account.

*   **When you create an account and buy tickets.** When you create an account, buy a ticket, register for a presale or have a ticket transferred to you by a friend, we will collect information directly from you. Depending on the service we are providing, this includes your contact and billing information, such as your name, street address, zip or postcode, email, phone number and credit card.
*   **When you buy tickets from third parties.** When you buy tickets from third-party e-commerce sites, the third party will send us information such as your contact and billing details and information about your ticket purchase for us to allocate your tickets to you.
*   **When using our websites and apps.** When you use our websites or apps, subject to your choices, we use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons and technology like GPS and WiFi to collect information about you. This information includes the browser and device you're using, your IP address, your location, the site you came from, what you did and didn't use our site/app for, or the site you visit when you leave us. Our site may also serve third-party content that contains their own cookies or tracking technology. For more information on how we collect this information, see our [Cookie Policy](https://privacy.ticketmaster.com/en/cookie-policy "Cookie Policy")
*   **When you contact our fan experience and customer support teams.** When you contact our Customer Services teams with a query or provide us with feedback, we record that interaction for evidentiary purposes and to provide support related to your query.
*   **When you use social media and online public forums.** When you use a social media feature within our website or apps, post to social media platforms, or post on a public space or on one of our websites, the social media site will provide us with some information about you, such as your name and the posts you make mentioning us.
*   **When posting ratings or reviews.** When you post ratings and reviews, including uploading images or videos as part of your review, we store this information in our platform alongside information about you as the reviewer.
*   **When you book accessible tickets.** If you have accessibility requirements, we want to make sure you have the best experience when attending events. To do this, we need to collect details of your requirements. When you purchase accessible tickets, or request a companion voucher, we record this request. Depending on your market, we may be required to validate your accessibility needs. We will inform you about this if we do.
*   **When you sell a ticket on Ticketmaster** As our payment services provider is transferring the funds from the ticket sale price to you, they need to collect information such as a valid ID as part of their Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Once your identity has been verified, this information is stored and securely deleted in line with regulatory requirements. Where local law requires, we also collect information from you when you use our services as a seller, including additional identification information such as tax identification numbers.
*   **Geodemographic information.** Subject to your choices, we collect or use suppliers such as advertising and marketing partners who collate geodemographic information including age range, gender, or information about events you like or products you buy which assists us in better personalizing our services to you. If you’d prefer that we do not do this, see the [‘Your Rights & Choices’](#your-choices-&-rights "Your Rights & Choices") section below.
*   **Information used for health & safety purposes.** Where required, we will collect information from ticket purchasers and attendees for compliance purposes related to infectious disease to the extent required under applicable law. This includes information such as names, contact details, seat locations, along with entry and exit times.

In situations where a third party for an event organizer requires the collection of health information (such as test results), please refer to their privacy policy and terms to understand how your information was collected and used.

HOW WE USE YOUR

INFORMATION AND WHY

This section explains how we use your information and the legal grounds (or purposes) for which we use it. Some purposes are primary purposes that are necessary in order for us to provide our services or products or to fulfill our legal obligations. Other secondary purposes aren’t strictly necessary to provide our services but provide additional value and are therefore typically subject to your choices.

2.  1.
    
    For the performance of our contract with you
    
    *   **When you make purchases.** We use your information when you transact with us (for example to buy merchandise or a ticket) so we can:
        *   process your order;
        *   send you customer service emails including booking confirmations and event reminders;
        *   take payment; and
        *   provide you with customer support.
    
    *   **Event Partner(s).** We share your information with Event Partner(s), such as the promoter or venue, to enable them to run the event, allocate seating or notify you if there has been a change to the event or provide important event information.
    
    *   **Presale & ballot sign up.** Some of our events have a sign up process where you will need to register ahead of time. We process submissions to limit fraudulent ticket purchases, to gauge demand, and ensure fans have equal opportunity to purchase tickets. If you are unsuccessful, it won’t stop you from purchasing tickets at a later date. For more information on how your information is used read our FAQs for [North America](https://help.ticketmaster.com/hc/en-us/articles/26794830612753-How-do-I-sign-up-and-access-tickets-through-an-artist-s-presale "https://help.ticketmaster.com/hc/en-us/articles/26794830612753-How-do-I-sign-up-and-access-tickets-through-an-artist-s-presale") or [International](https://help.ticketmaster.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/18384106791057-Why-do-some-ticket-sales-require-registration "https://help.ticketmaster.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/18384106791057-Why-do-some-ticket-sales-require-registration")
    
    *   **Contest, Competitions and Referrals.** When you enter into competitions or similar prize draws, we use your information to confirm your registration and to communicate to you about your entry. If you give us your friend's information, for example, via our referral service to tell a friend about our website or to purchase a gift card, we will only use your friend's information to provide services you requested. Your friend can contact us using the details below to ask us to delete their information.
    

4.  2.
    
    Subject to your choices
    
    *   **Marketing.** To contact you with information or offers regarding upcoming events, products or services via email, push and web notifications, SMS, or social media platforms. You can change your marketing preferences at any time; see [“Your choices and rights”](#your-choices-&-rights "Your choices and rights") section below.
    *   **Advertising & cookies.** To deliver tailored advertising and marketing communications on our websites and apps; see our [Cookie Policy](https://privacy.ticketmaster.com/en/cookie-policy "Cookie Policy") for more information.
    *   **Market research & fan feedback.** To conduct market research and analysis which helps improve and customize our products and services and to contact you with satisfaction surveys, or to participate in user research (such as focus groups). We include an unsubscribe option for this kind of contact should you no longer wish to receive them.
    *   **Personalization.** To make sure our messages and website are relevant to you (depending on your market). For example, when you ‘favorite’ certain artists and genres, purchase tickets, attend shows with friends and sign up for presales, we will inform you about similar events we think you might be interested in. We create a user profile with the information we have and how you use our services. By turning personalization off you won’t get any personal recommendations and any newsletters you’ve subscribed to will be generic (although if you’ve asked to receive alerts about specific artists or venues, you’ll still receive these).
        
        We will still perform profiling activities where we need to so we can deliver our services to you, for example for fraud screening purposes.
        
    *   **Location-based services.** For example, our apps request location permission for functions like browsing events near you, receiving push notifications about them or seeing yourself on the map at an event.
    *   **Accessibility.** To process your health information to meet your accessibility requirements, where specifically required, and explicit consent is provided.
    *   **Commercial Partners.** We sometimes work with Commercial Partners who we share information with. These are third party data controllers that we work with to provide additional value-add services, such as our travel packages, sponsors or exclusive presale. In some circumstances, where sharing is not necessary for us to perform the contract you have requested, we will ask for your permission.
    

6.  3.
    
    For our overriding legitimate business interests
    
    *   **To prevent or detect unlawful behavior, to protect or enforce our legal rights or as otherwise permitted by law.** For example, making sure tickets get into the hands of fans and to provide a secure platform. As such, we use this information to prevent ticket touting, misuse of our intellectual property (e.g. our Event Partners’ brands), fraud, or other crimes. For the purposes of fraud prevention, we share your Personal Information with Forter, Inc., our third-party provider of fraud screening services, who may use such information in accordance with the Forter [privacy policy](https://www.forter.com/services-privacy-policy/ "https://www.forter.com/services-privacy-policy/").
    *   **Site Protection.** This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy "https://policies.google.com/privacy") and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms "https://policies.google.com/terms") apply.
    *   **Event security.** To protect our fans and ensure the security of our and our Event Partners’ operations.

8.  4.
    
    To protect your vital interests

    **Do Not Track.** Our websites and apps are not designed to respond to "do not track" requests from browsers.
    
    Our websites respond to global privacy control—or “GPC”—signals, if we detect that a browser is communicating a GPC signal, we will process that as a request to opt that browser and device out of ‘sale’ via cookies and tracking tools on our website. Note that if you return to our website from a different device or use a different browser on the same device, you will need to opt out (or set GPC for) that browser and device as well.
    

LOOKING AFTER YOUR

INFORMATION

We have security measures in place to protect your information. The security measures we use will depend on the type of information collected. If you think that an unauthorized account has been created using your name, contact us. We are not responsible for third party websites and apps. If you click on a third-party link, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those websites. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully.

#### How long do we retain your personal information?

**Your Ticketmaster Account.** Your account is your digital identity on Ticketmaster; it is how we ensure your ticket purchases are secure and connected to an individual. It is also the primary basis for determining how long we keep your information.

Whenever you purchase a ticket, log into your account, or interact with us, we log this activity. So long as your account remains active we will continue to retain the information we have processed about you. For example we will:

*   Retain your purchases or favorites so we can recommend relevant events;
*   Keep your tickets assigned to you, so we continue to deliver events to true fans; and
*   Keep your account validated and secure.

Your information will be deleted if you either (1) request deletion of your account, in which case your account and associated information will be deleted within a maximum of 90 days depending on the timeframes required by your local laws; or (2) your account has 7 years’ of inactivity.

Aside from this account-based rule, the retention of your information is also determined on the following bases:

*   **To provide you with the services you have requested.** For example, when you purchase tickets or services from us, we cannot delete your account while you have an upcoming event, as you would not be able to attend the event you have purchased.
*   **When a law requires us to retain your information.** For example, we retain certain purchase information for accounting and tax purposes even after you have deleted your account.
*   **When we have processed information with your consent.** For example, if you have provided us with details of your accessible needs, if you withdraw your consent to this processing, we would delete that information.
*   **Safety & Security.** We also maintain limited information in separate databases to keep our platforms safe and secure, such as to detect and prevent fraud, to power cyber security protections and to enforce our terms and any attempt to circumvent them.

When our retention periods are triggered, we either:

*   Securely delete the information; or
*   We anonymize the information. For example, where we would like to report on year-on-year sales, we retain the sales information, but remove any information linking the sales back to individuals who made the purchases.

#### Transfers of your personal information

As a part of a global group of companies headquartered in the United States, we sometimes need to transfer your information outside of your country of residency. This occurs where:

*   We rely on shared services provided by the Ticketmaster group of companies, some of which may be located outside of the country where you are resident. For example, our global platform is designed and maintained primarily from the United States and the United Kingdom.
*   When world-class acts are touring, in order to provide you a seamless experience, your information may be transferred internationally if that is not based in your country of residence.
*   We use global service providers, such as the ones noted above.

When transferring information, there are strict rules in place to ensure your information is still protected to the highest standard. Where we do this, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place. Where your information is transferred outside of your local market, we use contractual measures and internal mechanisms requiring the recipient to comply with the privacy standards of the exporter. We will use contractual clauses, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission and other Regulatory Bodies where applicable.

Information Relevant

To Your Country

The data controller that processes your information depends on which market you have an account or subscription with. The Ticketmaster family of companies also provides support services on behalf of one another and therefore acts as processors on behalf of the data controller to whom you have provided your information.
