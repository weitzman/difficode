## 1\. How We Collect, Use, and Share Your Personal Information

**1.1. Identifiers** When you create an Account, complete your Account profile, place an order, sign up for a mailing list, or otherwise communicate or interact with us (whether or not through an Account), we collect identifiers such as your name, address, phone number, and email address. We may also collect identifiers like your name or email address from other people or businesses.

## 2\. Control Over Your Personal Information

**2.1. Opting Out of Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising or “Sales” of your Information**.

Under the laws of certain U.S. states, you may have the right to opt out of our processing or sharing of your information for online cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. Note that certain state laws also allow you to opt out of the “sale” of your information to third parties in exchange for valuable consideration. While we do not sell your information in exchange for money, some of the ways described in Section 1 in which we may disclose your information to third parties or use analytics or online advertising tools that result in the disclosure of your information to third parties may be subject to this opt out right.

This includes providing third party online advertising and analytics partners, as well as certain trusted partners with whom we link your accounts, with identifiers, internet usage information, and commercial information (e.g., records of transactions and purchases) in order to personalize ads for our Services, measure ad campaigns and conduct analytics, and improve and market partnership benefits. If you would like to opt out of sharing your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising or out of “selling” your information, you may submit a request below:

*   For Grubhub, click [Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information](https://www.grubhub.com/help/privacy/opt-out).
*   For Seamless, click [Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information](https://www.seamless.com/help/privacy/opt-out).

You do not need to create an account with us to opt out, but we may ask you to provide additional personal information so that we can properly identify you to comply with your opt out request. We will only request personal information that is necessary to complete your request and use personal information provided in an opt out request to review and comply with the request. If you choose not to provide this information, we may only be able to process your request to the extent we are able to identify you in our data systems, including only processing your request on the device from which you submitted the request.

Some devices and browsers may have settings for limiting how website and app operators like Grubhub can sell your information or use it for cross-context behavioral advertising. While we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals from your browser at this time, if we detect that you have enabled a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal for your device or browser (such as Global Privacy Control), we will endeavor to recognize such preference in accordance with and to the extent required by applicable law in required locations.

If you are using an Apple iOS device, you may request that the Grubhub app not “track” you, in which case we will not collect your device’s IDFA or use information you provide through the app for cross-context behavioral advertising. Please note that even if you ask not to be tracked on an Apple iOS device, you should still click on one of the links above if you want to opt out of “selling” your data or of cross-context behavioral advertising through your browser.

**2.2. Controlling Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies.** You can use the methods described below to make certain choices regarding the use of cookies, pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. Please note that if you replace, change, or upgrade your browser or device, or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat these steps again. Disabling or removing cookies may negatively impact your experience using our Services, as some features may not work properly. Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies, you may not be able to block non-cookie technologies, or the changes to your settings may have no effect.

(i) Browser Controls You may be able to disable and manage some cookies through your browser settings. Many web browsers will allow you to: (i) be notified when your device is about to receive a cookie and choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) automatically reject all future cookies. If you use multiple browsers on the same device or if you use multiple devices, you will likely need to manage your settings for each browser or device individually.

(ii) Analytics To disable analytics cookies you can use the browser controls discussed above or, for some of our providers, you can use their individual opt-out mechanisms. For example, you can use the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) available here to prevent your browser from sharing data with Google Analytics.

(iii) Interest Based Advertising We allow certain third-party partners (e.g., third-party online advertising networks and other third-party services) to place tracking technologies on our Platform, and we participate in interest-based advertising. To learn about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, including certain browser-based cross-device tracking for advertising purposes, visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) website and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) website. You can also customize settings regarding Google network ads by visiting Google’s Ad Center. For more information about the Meta Pixel, please see Meta’s [Privacy Policy.](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) Finally, you may also be able to limit certain interest-based advertising on your mobile device through your device’s settings, including the “tracking” settings on iOS or by selecting “opt-out of interest based ads” on Android or by downloading the [AppChoices app](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices). After you use the opt out tools listed above, you will still see advertisements, but they may not be as relevant to you.

Any links to third-party websites or instructions on how you might use third-party tools to control your online experience are provided for your convenience only; we do not control the content or features that may be available on these third-party services. We encourage you to review the full terms and features of those tools to determine how they work and what ads they limit or restrict.

**2.3. Push Notifications and our Access to Your Device Information.** You may control our access to your device information or opt out of push notifications through the “Settings” app on your device. For instance, you can withdraw permission for the app to access your location data through your device settings, though we may continue to approximate your location based on your IP address or through other means.

**2.4. Communications Preferences.** You can stop receiving promotional email communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. You may not opt out of service-related communications (e.g., account verification, transactional communications, changes/updates to features of the services, technical and security notices). You may also unsubscribe from receiving certain order-related text (SMS) or multimedia (MMS) messages by replying "STOP" to the number sending the message. Please see our [Terms of Use](https://www.grubhub.com/legal/terms-of-use) for more information on communications from or on behalf of Grubhub.

**2.5. Additional Rights Regarding Your Personal Information**. Depending on your jurisdiction, including California and Colorado, you may have the right to request certain actions with respect to your data. We will endeavor to honor your requests regardless of the state where you live, where possible and consistent with law, but are not under an obligation to do so.

You may submit a request to get a copy of your Personal Information, to understand what we collect and how we disclose your Personal Information, or to delete your Personal Information. We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account.

In certain circumstances, we may decline such a request, such as when we are unable to verify your identity, or when we are unable to delete your information for legal or regulatory reasons. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request.

You may submit a request through the following links:

*   For Grubhub, click [here](https://www.grubhub.com/help/privacy/manage-your-data).
*   For Seamless, click [here](https://www.seamless.com/help/privacy/manage-your-data).

Alternatively, you may email us at [privacy@grubhub.com](mailto:privacy@grubhub.com) with the subject line “Privacy Request.”

You may also correct or update your personal information, such as your name, email address, address, payment information, and phone number, in your [account profile page](https://www.grubhub.com/account/profile).

If you choose to use any of these methods to manage your data, we will not penalize you, charge you different prices, or provide different quality of services, except to the extent you limit our ability to process personal information needed to provide our Services. For example, if you have your data deleted, we may no longer be able to provide you with our products and Services or engage with you in the same manner.

If you have any questions about your request, you may email us at [privacy@grubhub.com](mailto:privacy@grubhub.com). Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia residents may also have the right to appeal the denial of a request made by emailing [privacy@grubhub.com](mailto:privacy@grubhub.com), and we will respond within the legally required time period, including a written explanation of the results of your appeal.

**2.6. Requests From Others on Your Behalf.** In certain circumstances, you may permit someone else (an “authorized agent”) to submit requests about your information on your behalf. The authorized agent must provide sufficient evidence to show that the authorized agent has authority to act on your behalf, including, without limitation, proof that the authorized agent has been lawfully vested with power of attorney. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.

Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we may direct communications in response to an authorized agent’s request to you rather than to the authorized agent. For example, we may need to verify your identity and confirm directly with you that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request, and it may take additional time to fulfill requests from authorized agents.

## 3\. How We Store and Protect Your Information

**3.1. Data Storage and Transfer.** If you create an Account on the Platform as a visitor from outside the United States, by using and/or accessing the Platform or Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of your information to and in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

**3.2. Data Security.** Grubhub employs physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through our Platform and Services. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems. Please recognize that protecting your personal information is also your responsibility. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that you change your passwords often and not reuse passwords, use a combination of letters and numbers, make sure you use a secure browser, and otherwise take precautions when communicating your personal information on the internet. If you know or have reason to believe that your Account credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Account, please contact us following the instructions in the Contact Us section below.

## 4\. Children’s Personal Information

Our websites and online Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16, nor do we knowingly sell or share personal information of children under the age of 16.

If you have knowledge that we have collected personal information from a child under 16, please contact us at [privacy@grubhub.com](mailto:privacy@grubhub.com).

## 5\. Third-Party Websites

Our websites and online Services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications.

## 6\. Promotional Activities

We may offer promotional activities, such as contests, sweepstakes, joint promotional activities, or co-branded services, from time to time. You should carefully review the rules and/or terms of each promotion in which you participate, as the promotion may contain additional important information about our, a sponsor's, and/or other third party's use of your personal information. To the extent that the rules or terms of those promotions concerning the treatment of your personal information conflict with this Privacy Policy, the rules of those promotions will control. When such disclosure is necessary to fulfill your request or application or otherwise enable your participation in the promotion, we will disclose personal information to the promotion’s co-sponsors.
