**2\. When you use our services**

**3\. From other sources**

**Please go [here](https://www.uber.com/global/en/privacy/overview/) for a summary of the data we collect and how we use it.**

Uber collects the following data:

**1\. Data you provide**: This includes:

**2\. Data collected when you use our services**: This includes:

**3\. Data from other sources**: These include:

### B. How we use data

**Uber uses data to enable reliable and convenient transportation, delivery, and other products and services. We also use data:**

*   **To enhance the safety and security of our users and services, and to prevent and detect fraud**
*   **For marketing and advertising**
*   **To enable communications between users**
*   **For customer support**
*   **For research and development**
*   **To send non-marketing communications to users**
*   **In connection with legal proceedings**

**1\. To provide our services.** Uber uses data to provide, personalize, maintain, and improve our products and services.

**2\. For safety, security, and fraud prevention and detection.** We use data to help maintain the safety and security of our services and users.

**3\. For marketing and advertising.** Uber uses data (except Guest Users’ data) to market its services, and those of Uber partners.

**4\. To enable communications between users.**

**5\. For customer support.**

**6\. For research and development.**

**7\. For non-marketing communications.**

**8\. For legal proceedings and requirements.**

### C. Core automated processes

**Uber uses automated processes to enable certain parts of our products and services, including functions essential for service delivery and user safety such as matching, pricing and fraud prevention and detection.**

Uber relies on automated processes to enable essential parts of our services, including matching (pairing users requesting and providing transportation and/or delivery services), pricing (calculating the amount owed for such services) and fraud detection and prevention. These processes allow Uber to provide a seamless, and safe, experience to millions of users globally every day.

This section describes how automated matching, pricing, and fraud prevention and detection processes work, including how they impact your Uber experience and the personal and non-personal data used to enable these processes.

You may contact Uber [here](https://help.uber.com/riders/article/submit-a-privacy-inquiry?nodeId=489292a2-27ce-42f5-9a47-d4dd017559fd) if you have questions or concerns regarding these processes.

Uber uses algorithms to efficiently match you with drivers or delivery people. This helps us minimize wait times for you and enable efficiency for drivers and delivery people.

The matching process is triggered when you request transportation or deliveries. Our algorithms then evaluate various factors to determine the best match, including your location, requested destination, the proximity and availability of drivers or delivery people, traffic conditions, and historical data (including, in some markets, whether you and a driver have previously reported having negative experiences with each other).

The trip or delivery request is then communicated to the driver/delivery person matched through this process. Once a trip or order is accepted, we send confirmation of the match to you and the driver/delivery person.

We are constantly refining our matching process to provide the best experience to all users on our platform and may consider different factors depending on the location where you use Uber.

Additional information on Uber’s matching process is available [here](https://www.uber.com/us/en/marketplace/matching/).

When you request transportation or a delivery, Uber uses algorithms to determine the price you pay based on a variety of factors, including:

*   Trip/order Information, including the type of service you request (for instance, UberX, UberXL, Uber Black), restaurant or merchant name and location, and order value
*   Your location
*   Estimated time and distance to destination
*   Availability and proximity of drivers or delivery people
*   Time of day
*   Traffic conditions
*   Historical data such as traffic patterns and seasonal trends

Your price may also vary depending on tolls or surcharges incurred, tips, discounts, promotions and subscriptions, and route-based adjustments.

The price may also vary depending on surge pricing, which automatically goes into effect when there are more Riders in a given area than available drivers. This encourages more drivers to serve the busy area over time and shifts Rider demand, to maintain reliability and restore balance.

Additional information on Uber’s pricing process is available [here](https://www.uber.com/us/en/marketplace/pricing/).

Uber uses algorithms to prevent and detect fraud against Uber or our users. This includes efforts to monitor for account takeovers, suspicious user behaviors, and unauthorized access attempts, including by third-party aggregators.

These tools look for patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior, such as those that vary significantly from typical user behavior. To do this, Uber performs real-time monitoring of information collected from or generated by users, including location data, payment information, and Uber usage. We also examine historical data and compare it against real-time data to help detect suspicious behavior.

Uber may limit your access to its services, or require that you undertake a particular action such as verifying your identity before allowing such access, if it detects potential fraudulent activity.

You may contact Uber customer support [here](https://help.uber.com/riders) if you have questions or concerns about these processes.

### D. Cookies and related technologies

### E. Data sharing and disclosure

Uber may share your data if we believe it’s required by applicable law, regulation, operating license or agreement, legal process or governmental request, insurance policy, or where the disclosure is otherwise appropriate due to safety or similar concerns.

This includes sharing data with law enforcement officials, public health officials, other government authorities, insurance companies, third-party fleet partners, or other third parties as necessary to enforce our [terms and conditions](https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=general-terms-of-use&country=united-states&lang=en), user agreements, or other policies; to protect Uber’s rights or property or the rights, safety or property of others; or in the event of a claim or dispute relating to the use of our services. In the event of a dispute relating to use of another person’s credit card, we may be required by law to share a user’s data, including trip or order information, with the owner of that credit card.

For more information, please see Uber’s [Guidelines for United States Law Enforcement](https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=guidelines-for-law-enforcement) and [Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests and Service of Legal Documents](https://www.uber.com/legal/data-requests/guidelines-for-third-party-data-requests/en/).

We may also share data with others in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company.

### F. Data retention and deletion

**Uber retains your data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. Users may request account deletion through the Uber apps and websites.**

Uber retains your data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. Those periods vary depending on the type of data, and the purposes for which we collect and maintain it.

For example, we retain your data:

*   for as long as you maintain your Uber account (i.e., the life of your account, or “LOA”) where it is necessary in order for Uber to provide its service. This includes account information, like your first and last name, email, phone number and payment information.
*   for 7 years from collection (unless you first delete your Uber account) if necessary for purposes of Uber’s tax, insurance, legal or regulatory requirements; subject to Uber’s legitimate interests in defending against, or asserting, legal claims; or where necessary for purposes such as research and development.
*   for only as long as required to enable specific services or features. For example, if you submit an image of your ID to verify your age for purposes of alcohol delivery where required by law, we delete such images within 48 hours unless longer retention is required by law.

The following table lists Uber’s retention practices with respect to categories of data described above. Uber may retain data for longer, or shorter, than the periods described below where required by law.

Where Uber does not need to retain your data in order for Uber to provide its services, or for purposes of our tax, insurance, legal or regulatory requirements, we will delete your data once no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected it. Such periods vary depending on the type of data, and the purposes for which we collected it. For example, we generally delete certain information that we use to display personalized marketing and advertising to you after approximately one year, if not sooner.

You may request that we delete your account through the Privacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uber’s website (Riders and Order Recipients [here](https://help.uber.com/h/24010fe7-7a67-4ee5-9938-c734000b144a); Guest Users [here](https://help.uber.com/riders/article/submit-a-privacy-inquiry-without-an-uber-account?nodeId=eb90a9bb-8286-4c10-ae28-fb641b889bac)).

Following an account deletion request, we delete your account and data, except as necessary for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention or compliance with legal requirements, or because of issues relating to your account (such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute). For example, if you are banned from Uber’s services because of serious fraudulent or unsafe behavior, Uber will retain your data after an account deletion request to prevent you from re-obtaining access to Uber’s platform.

The data that we retain in such situations varies depending on the purpose for the retention. For example, if we retain your data due to fraudulent behavior, we will retain the data relating to such behavior, and the data that we need to prevent you from further accessing Uber’s platform, which may include your account information, identity verification information, transaction data, and user content and communications data. Similarly, if you are involved in an incident while using Uber that may lead to litigation or an insurance claim, we will retain the data that is potentially relevant to such litigation or insurance claim.

We generally delete data within 90 days of an account deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.

(Burgerweeshuispad 301, 1076 HR Amsterdam, the Netherlands) regarding issues relating to Uber's processing of your personal data and your data protection rights.

### B. Our legal bases for using your data

**Depending on where you use our services, and our purpose for using your data, Uber relies on the following legal bases for processing your data:**

*   **Necessity to perform our contract with you**
*   **Consent**
*   **Uber's legitimate interests**
*   **Legal obligation**

Data protection laws in some countries and areas, including the EEA, UK, Switzerland, Brazil and Nigeria, only allow Uber to use your data when certain circumstances defined under those laws apply. This is called having a “legal basis” for using your data. The applicability of these legal bases may depend on your location. The chart below indicates the legal bases that Uber has under those laws when they do apply, and it uses your data for the purposes described in this notice.

### C. Legal framework for data transfers

**Uber operates, and processes user data, globally. We comply with applicable legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.**

Uber operates, and processes user data, globally. This may result in processing of your personal data in countries, including the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from those where you live or are located.

This includes processing of your data on Uber’s servers in the United States, and transferring or enabling access to your data globally, in order to:

*   Provide you services wherever you request them
*   Provide you access to your information, such as trip/order history, wherever you request it
*   Provide access to and responses from Uber’s customer service agents
*   Respond to [requests for information](https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=guidelines-for-law-enforcement&country=united-states&lang=en) by governments or law enforcement, as necessary

Uber is committed to protecting your personal data regardless of where you are located or where, or by whom, your personal data is processed. This includes implementing global measures to protect users’ data, including:

*   Securing user data when in transit, including through encryption, and at rest.
*   Mandating company-wide training regarding privacy and data security.
*   Implementing internal policies and procedures to limit access to, and use of, users’ data.
*   Limiting government and law enforcement access to user data, except where required by law; there are imminent threats to safety; or users have consented to the access.

When we transfer user data from the EEA, UK and Switzerland, we do so on the basis of the necessity to fulfill our agreements with you, consent, adequacy decisions regarding the country of transfer (available [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en), [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D1772) or [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32000D0518)), and transfer mechanisms such as the [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) adopted by the European Commission (and their approved equivalents for the UK and Switzerland), and the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (“EU-US DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-US DPF”), as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. Such data remains subject to the GDPR or equivalents after such transfer. Users may contact Uber regarding the above, or to request copies of applicable Standard Contractual Clauses, [here](https://help.uber.com/riders/article/submit-a-privacy-inquiry?nodeId=489292a2-27ce-42f5-9a47-d4dd017559fd).

UTI has certified to the United States Department of Commerce that it adheres to (1) the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles regarding the processing of personal data received from EEA member countries in reliance on the EU-US DPF, and from the UK (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF; and (2) the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework Principles regarding the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-US DPF. In the event of a conflict between this notice and the Principles mentioned above, the Principles shall govern. In the event that the EU-US DPF or the Swiss-US DPF are invalidated, Uber will transfer data that is subject to these certifications in reliance on the other data transfer mechanisms described above.

You may contact Uber [here](https://help.uber.com/riders/article/submit-a-privacy-inquiry?nodeId=489292a2-27ce-42f5-9a47-d4dd017559fd) with questions regarding our compliance with these Principles. You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority, and Uber will work with that authority to resolve that complaint. In certain circumstances, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the [DPF Principles](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction).
