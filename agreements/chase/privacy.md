### Learn how to steer clear of scammers when using Zelle®

Zelle® [Footnote 1Opens overlay](/content/dam/chaseux-fragments/en/chase-footnotes-and-disclosures/personal/cpc/zelle) is a fast and convenient way to send and receive money with people and businesses you know and trust who have an eligible account at a participating U.S. financial institution. But using it to send money to someone you don’t know, or to pay for merchandise or services you can’t be sure you’ll get, can be risky.

## Stay one step ahead of scams

Learn more about the common tricks scammers are using to help keep yourself safe.

### Pay yourself  

"Did you authorize this transaction? Send the money to yourself using Zelle® [Footnote 1Opens overlay](/content/dam/chaseux-fragments/en/chase-footnotes-and-disclosures/personal/cpc/zelle)."

**TIP:** Chase will never ask you to send money back to yourself to reverse fraud on your account or to fix an issue.

### For sale, hot deal

"Get a great price on these exclusive sneakers. You can pay using cash or a payment app."

**TIP:** Be cautious of great "deals" on social media sites. Once you send money you may not get it back.

### Computer virus  

"We've detected malware on your computer. Let's get that fixed for you. There will be a small cost to make your computer secure."

**TIP:** Never give anyone remote access to your computer unless you can 100% verify who they are.
